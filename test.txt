Have only done tapas here.   Must.  Get.  Ham croquettes.   Those and the stuffed plantains.  Lollipop chicken good, ribs good, Cuban sandwich ace, empanadas solid.  Reasonably priced, service attentive, nice walkway to the restaurant.	4.0
I have heard of this place from multiple people over the past two or three years but somehow haven't paid a visit to it myself which I now bitterly regret. A friend took me to lunch there on a recent Thursday and I was simply amazed: from the very entrance all the way to my plate I felt transported to little Cuba in Florida. The atmosphere and decorum of the place distract you from everyday; the music, the waiters and the FOOD complete the job of taking you on vacation. The experience was so amazing that two days later I returned for dinner and the place did not disappoint. The food was dancing with flavors, attractively plated with generous portions one could share. The menu has impressive variety and the waiters know it very well and are happy to navigate it with you. I can't wait to return for another culinary excursion!	5.0
I came here for dinner on a weeknight around six and was seated immediately. Although the place is big it feels small and was very warm. Saying it was loud is an understatement. The music is blaring so get ready to scream if you want to be heard. Our waiter was attentive to the point of hovering. By the time we left it was packed. The food was the highlight - Bahamas coconut fish cooked well, nice sides and enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I would like to go back to dine outside, but unless I'm with a rowdy  (drunk) crew the inside is not for me.	3.0
Food is good and the environment is very nice. It was a little loud for me but nothing I couldn't deal with. I took my dad and brother when they came to visit and they liked it as well.	4.0
Apparently you cannot get in to this place on weekends, but my friend and I were looking for a fun lunch spot and Yelp lead us here. It was busy for 3pm on a Saturday, but we got sat right away. After learning it's BYOB my friend went to the liquor store next door and came back with wine to they could mix us up a pitcher of Sangria. We got 4 tapas, ranging from $4-5 and 1 entree to share and there was plenty for a 3rd person or leftovers to take home. The stuffed plantains were a highlight and something I have not had at other restaurants!	4.0
Good food, nice service, SUPER LOUD. But definitely come here and try it for yourself!	4.0
Cuban food fit for a king...coconut rice is a praise worthy side to entrees...the mambo king is a tasty favorite...but the chicken, pork chops, and shrimp are all delicious...definitely get appetizers...the maduros, pernil, black beans, & tostadas are all very tasty. The lollipop chicken with the garlic sauce are the wow factor here...absolutely delicious...i've tried every flavor mojito and they are phenomenal in flavor...bring your favorite wine to spike it and have a girl's night.	5.0
Great food at very reasonable prices. Try the back wrapped dates and goat cheese fritters to start. Their coconut shrimp entree and short rib entree are outstanding. You can skip dessert as it's not to good and my Cuban coffee was cold and cost $4. Bring either rum for their mojito mix or wine for their sangria mix.	4.0
Other 5 star reviews are spot on.  Not much to add, went there only one time but loved it.	5.0
I finally had the chance to try this place out. I've heard nothing but great things and couldn't wait to finally go. I had the steak with coconut rice and it was absolutely delicious. My girlfriend got the shrimp appetizer and empenadas as well and those were both delicious. The atmosphere was great and the music wasn't as loud as I expected it to be. Service was super friendly as well. I definitely cannot wait to go back again.	5.0
I've never been to Montclair before but have only heard really great things about the town.  So, when a friend and I were making dinner plans to get together with our significant others to catch up, I chose Montclair as the mutual town to meet in.   As I didn't have a clue as to what restaurants were good or bad in Montclair, I turned to the reviews on Yelp to help me decide.  I chose Cuban Pete's because the reviews were overall pretty good and I also liked that it was a BYOB place.   Since the restaurant does not take reservations, we just decided to meet at 7:30 this past Saturday.  There is no off-street parking and it was difficult to find parking near the restaurant.  There are a few public parking lots that charge between $5 - $10, so in the interest of saving time and not driving around in endless circles looking for a spot, we just parked in one of those. The restaurant is well decorated and looks very nice both on the outside and inside.  I can totally picture having a great time here on a beautiful summer night.  There is outside seating between the two buildings that serve as the inside part of the restaurant.  I love the hanging lights and the palm trees along the pathway into the restaurant's main building.  Very nice touch on the ambiance.   When we got to the restaurant, there were a ton of people waiting for a table.  I mean, I have NEVER seen so many people waiting to get into a place.  We put our name on the list and waited about an hour.  The hostess skipped over our name, even though we were right by the door and checked in several times to see when we'd be seated.  Initially, the hostess was unwilling to do anything about the fact that she skipped over us on the list but the manager (?) stepped in and got us seated once he realized his hostess had made a mistake.   Although it was a bit of a hassle to wait so long, ultimately when we sat down, the service was pretty good.  The servers all seem like they are really working hard to make sure the patrons of their restaurant enjoy their experience.  Our server was nice, but very busy.  Our food came out pretty quickly but the Sangria we had ordered to mix with our wine that we brought came out after we got our food.  Our server apologized and said the Sangria was on the house.  Whether it was he who forgot or there was a delay at the bar, it was nice of him to comp the Sangria for us.  Sangria was pretty good with the red wine we mixed.   For our entrees, my fiance had the Vaca Fritas (crispy shredded beef) and I had the Churrasco El Gaucho (skirt steak).  I really enjoyed my steak and the rice that came with my dish was delicious.  The yuka could've been cooked a little longer but it was still good.  My fiance really enjoyed his dish although I thought it was a bit overcooked.  I can't recall entirely what our friends had but they both said they would definitely come back here to eat.   I think if we're ever in the area again and the wait not super long, we'd come back also.	4.0
Great food and atmosphere! I typically have the pollo cubano and sangria. There's usually a long wait so try to arrive early.	5.0
Place is gorgeous ! The food is amazing .. If you like authentic Cuban food . This is it !!! I came here for a friends birthday, and I'm telling you the food smells amazing even when they walk by with other dishes (lol) Great spot for a date night, or night out with family. I will definitely be coming back here.	5.0
Being Cuban born and raised I have expectations of Cuban restaurants. This place was just exceptional, we were party of four, Sat night and had to wait 1hr to be seated, but it was worth every minute. Music is great as well as ambience, its BYOB like most places in NJ, the macitas de puerco for apetizers are delicious, full of flavor, juicy. Four different entrees: Churrasco (amazing, juicy, well cooked), ropa vieja, pargo all were delicious. I must say this place is legit Cuban food. Woods totally recommend it and will def be coming back, don't care the wait.	5.0
Came here on a Monday night...plate was dirty. I asked for a clean one. Second plate was dirty. Water glass was dirty. It really set the wrong tone. I ordered the fried snapper. Huge mistake. It was oily and not crispy. I think it was refried. It was definitely not fresh. Lemonade was horrible and had a huge clump of sugar at the bottom of glass. I doubt I'll be back. Server was good. What happen to this place?!	2.0
Excellent place, very energetic. Wait time is not bad, food wait is short. Very cool place!	5.0
I love this place. I visited yesterday around 4:30pm and it was perfect. No line, was seated right away. I ordered the guayaba chicken and my husband ordered the churassco. Both meals were very delicious!! We had the caramel custard flan as a dessert. Amazing! Staff is friendly and very hard working. The atmosphere is always a pleasure. Few tips: They do not take reservations so if you go during the weekend go early like I did, otherwise you'll be waiting in a 2hour line. Pack quarters for parking because that's really the only option you have close to the restaurant. Lovely town, amazing restaurant. Oh, ps.....this is a byob restaurant.	4.0
Been here 5 times. I stop in whenever I have business in that area and I like to try something different each time and so far everything I've eaten has been on point! I wish this place wasn't an hour away from where I live! Last time I had the pernil and it was just sooooo good!! This place is well put together from the decor to the service to the food! Can't wait to go back!!	5.0
Came here twice and it was great! Food was fresh both times, it was flavorful and they have many options to choose from. One thing I really did enjoy is the dessert! Be sure to order Flan, it's probably one of the most amazing things you will ever taste. I think we had seven orders of flan between the two visits. The atmosphere is lovely, they have seating indoors and outdoors. They have been very busy both times, and it gets very loud but we were seated almost immediately. Service is spot on, the servers are knowledgable about the menu, friendly, and will add to your overall pleasant dining experience. Give it a try next time you're around, don't forget the flan! :)	5.0
After telling my boyfriend about this place for quite some time now I finally convinced him to drive the 20 mins with me to Cuban Pete's for dinner. Parking is usually an issue but we pulled rite up front of the building and walked in. We were seated rite away in a location that turned out to be what seemed the loudest area in the entire restaurant I couldn't even hear by boyfriend speaking to me. I ordered the same tapas as last time chicken lollipops, goat cheese fritters, plantanos rellenos, and the beef empenadas. The chicken lollipops were bland so I asked the waiter for some hot sauce only about 5 times before he actually brought it to the table. I felt they had more flavor the first time I tried them. The goat cheese fritters seemed sweeter the last time I had them but I feel they could use something else to them its too much goat cheese flavor. The empenadas (beef) were flaky and delicious so that was consistent along with the plantanos rellenos. My main disappointment was the size of my churrasco. The first time I came here and ordered it the portion was huge, this time not so much. My steak was maybe 2 inches wide and ity bity. I should of taken a picture to compare but I was really just unhappy. My boyfriend ordered the cuban pete's paella which he said was lacking flavor and just ok. The service was really lacking last night so much that I waited 20 mins to be able to get a hold of my waiter and receive a check. It's gonna be a while before I come back. To me this is place is hit or miss and lacking consistency.	3.0
Visited a couple of weeks ago during a business trip. Great ambiance with the music, authentically garbed staff and beautiful courtyard seating area. My companion and I both had churrascos. Mine with classic chimichurri sauce on the skirt steak and my companions el gaucho with a chipotle flavored sauce. Both excellent. For starters we had the mini cuban sandwiches (bocaditos) and sangria ceviche with a tasty tigerfish. They serve sangria but allow you to BTOB with no corkage fee. Taste of the caribbean in downtown Montclair	4.0
the oxtail dish is delicious!!	5.0
Went to this place a back. The sangria flavors are all awesome. The decor  is nice and suited to the restaurant  theme. The food was amazing  and you can not really go wrong. The best part is that they are  byob. There is also a liquor store near by that offers discounts if you are dining at Cuban Pete's. Overall this a great spot. There may be a wait for seating depending on the night but its well worth it.	4.0
The food and sangria are delicious but the service is horrible.	3.0
Five stars for being consistent . Paella has just right amount of spices. Yes it is frustrating to drive to Montclair and wait so long- plan for it and you'll do fine. Patience... It has a lively loud atmosphere. Don't go here if you want to quietly talk to your date. Go here if you want to experience a party level noise and lots of people. Lots of people.!!!! I go for the food and have patience for the rest. Recommend !	5.0
Before anyone reading this jumps down my throat...I'm a vegetarian and I did not pick this place by choice. So it was one of my friend's birthdays and she insisted on cuban food. I had heard great things about this place so we decided to give it a go. We came here super early (before 5PM) on a wednesday. The servers looked super excited to actually have customers. We ended up sitting outside which was a bad choice because it was windy and chilly. The tables are small so I had nowhere to place my purse and the chairs weren't functional for purse holding either. I know it sounds like I'm a diva already... I ended up ordering the coconut rice with mango yams and the carlito's way chicken...but my friend took the chicken. I don't know if it was just this particular dish but it was so incredibly sweet I felt like there were just heaps of sugar poured onto all the food. I literally had three bites and was so turned off. I ordered dinner, not dessert, right? I'm sure there are other things on this menu which are more appetizing but my first time was not my best here. Plus I had zero alcohol so that may need to be added into the equation next time.	2.0
The food here is ALWAYS DEELISH!!! I love the Paella! The fish is heavenly! Cuban Pete's does it for me! I'm in love!!!!!	5.0
This restaurant is BYOB the food is excellent.. I've been here several times and always try different dishes and have been satisfied with all of them.. The only downfall is that they don't make reservations on weekends and it gets really packed so the wait time is very long..	4.0
Good Cuban food, can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Where you can go wrong is by expecting to be seated right away and a quiet atmosphere. Out of the 10 or so times I've attempted to dine here, I've only succeeded 3 times. Once there was a 3 hour wait, you read that right... 3 HOURS! So come early if you want to eat.	4.0
It was a great experience when we did visit this restaurant.   I did love the place ..alot of people...The skirt steak was cooked to perfection plus the chorizo in red wine is my favorite.  The service was good too and attentive...Its worth to go here !	4.0
This is one of my favorite places to eat. The waiters are sexy and friendly and the food is amazing. It's always packed but so worth the wait.	5.0
This is my absolute favorite Cuban restaurant in NJ. It is such a fun environment! I love when they play the drums for birthdays! I also love the punches to mix with your BYOB alcohol. Don't make the mistake of not bringing your own alcohol if you plan on drinking, you'll be sad looking around like I did the first time! That's no fun. So the food! I always order the same thing! For starters, I love the papitas rellenas. It is a fried mashed potato ball stuffed with meat and served on salsa. Taste so much better than it sounds. For my entree, I get the churassco steak with spicy sauce, medium, with coconut rice instead of the regular rice it comes with and a side of yuca! It comes with plantain and black beans. The steak is always so tender. Definitely a fun place to eat with your friends. Be prepared for a wait on weekend nights though!	4.0
Went to Cuban Pete's the other night with family, we got a table outside, really cool the way they decorated the patio. Looks like your in cuba. It is a BYOB so if you bring your wine they will make you a sangria also have mojitos available at 5% alcohol. we tried all the appetizers and they were very good. I had the (Lechon Asado) pork with the white rice and black beans,it was very moist and tender. the skirt steak was also good, for desert I had the empanadas filled with bananas and that was excellent.	3.0
Cuban Pete's always delivers great food...I love that it's a BYOB so me an my friends always come with peach Ciroc and create a mixed drink with the mango mojito. Only issues I have is the waiting time to be seated at times and that it can get extremely noisy but overall this place is great been going here since I was in high school.	5.0
Everybody I talk to said their food is really good so i went there with my friends. Nice place! I like the layout of the restaurant, but my chicken wasn't cooked all the way I had better food other places. That's why I give it a three star. I will go back there again to try something different.	3.0
Cuban Pete's is a wonderful restaurant in Montclair.  Be warned: they don't take reservations and it gets crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings in the spring and summertime. It is worth the wait though for the atmosphere and good food.  I usually get the vaca frita (crispy shredded beef with onions and lime).  The portions are generous and I like how the lime flavor stands out in the dish. It is served with rice, black beans and plantains. I've tried many of the tapas as well including the croquetas and mini Cuban sandwiches.  Inside the mood is lively and the music is loud. The wait staff sings a fun happy birthday song as well for customers celebrating there.	5.0
Go here for lunch. It is not nearly as loud. The white sangria was excellent, even without alcohol. Pork was excellent, steak is ok as normal. I'd stick with the appetizers.	5.0
I hate to disagree with so many fellow yelpers but this joint is OVER RATED. The food is subpar, the service only so-so, the atmosphere unimpressive. Except for the courtyard. The courtyard is lovely. If you bring your own food, it's a wonderful place to dine.	2.0
4 stars for the great atmosphere, and, the cubaccino "delicioso". I love the setup of the place perfect for dates. It does not transport you to the Havana Cuba, but you definitely feel somewhere else. Music is loud nothing less to expect from a Cuban restaurant. The drinks are very good, you get a jar for $14 dollars very refreshing. The food is OK, not as succulent as Cuban food is. I had the paella, everything tasted fresh which is nice, but nothing to remember. My date had a skirt steak with a special hot sauce, he enjoyed, the only compliant he had was the moro rice which he said was dry.	4.0
Had a great time there. The food was very good, the place looks great and the staff was very friendly. Would definitely go back again. The only downside is that it can get pretty noisy.	4.0
What a fun place!  This is a must if you are in the area.  This establishment is BYOB.  They have pitchers of sangria's and etc to add to the alcohol you bring.  My friend and I went on a Saturday night and were seated promptly.  We ordered several tapas to share.  I had the papas rellenas which are delicious as always  I 've had the ropa vieja in the past and was hard not to order it this time since I wanted to try something new.  I had the ceviche made with tigerfish and citrus.  It was so refreshing and perfect for the summer.  I was a little disappointed with the stuffed plantains.  I felt there was barely any stuffing and they were a little dry.  The garlic shrimp is a must. I practically licked the plate. The atmosphere is fun and the decor is colorful and vibrant.  It was very loud inside and the servers played the bongos and sang to several tables for birthday celebrations.  Being a Saturday night, this was expected of course. The service was great and the waiter was always available.  I can't wait to return!	4.0
Very busy, a bit pricey, but worth the money, because the food is very tasty. I was there on a Friday night in May and the weather was so nice we got to sit outside. The wait was almost 2 hours though, so we had to go for a walk before they were ready to take us in. It was so packed we sat with someone else at the table, so it was a bit awkward at first, but joked that it's a double date and we enjoyed the rest of the evening. I heard it's always that packed on the weekend, so if you don't mind others looking over your shoulder while you eat then you should definitely go there :) It's on Boomfield Ave, so it's a challenge to find parking.	4.0
Excellent good food!!! fun times. I recommend the marinated chicken breast with black beans and coconut rice along with the plantains.  It is BYOB bring your own bottle for the sangria!!!	5.0
For food fantastic..i would have given it 5 stars, until you see the jerk they call the owner...so inappropriate with people and staff...its sad how miserable he is...if ever this place fails, it will be because of him!!!	1.0
Went here for my 21st birthday! The food was so good! The atmosphere was upbeat and they sang for me. There sangria was really good! Just make sure you get there early if u want to avoid the wait!	5.0
I went with a group of 12 people for a birthday.  Before, all of us were at the restaurant,  the manager told some of my friends to leave. When we were seated, the waiter served us drinks for more than 30 minutes.  After feeling so hungry, we had to ask the waiter to take our order. The waiter was not friendly at all- he actually came off a bit snobby. Since it was a friend's birthday, a request for the "mini band" was made. But, they decided to preform for another group of customers instead of us. The waiter then claimed the band have "performed" for us. Last , but not least the waiter then gave a wrong amount on the check and claimed it was correct. He was very adamant about the orders. Then the manager came out and proved the waiter wrong. After all the long waiting, the amount on the check was still wrong because he misread numbers on a calculator. To sum it up, this restaurant has very poor customer service.	1.0
I've been to this place numerous times and I feel like the more that I come here, the less service I receive! Food is great for the price,great late night hours. Just hope that the turnover of servers is not causing a downfall to this restaurant.	3.0
Get here early- the place is lively however their waiting method needs to be looked at.  Your in a crowded area waiting for a table standing over other  people eat.	4.0
Where do I start.  Extremely rude staff and who I can only assume was the manager was so unhelpful and disrespectful.   It was almost like they don't want your money.  Apps were very good (that's why they got 1 star)  main course was really bad.  It tasted and looked sat under a heat lamp for hours.  My wife's lechon was completely dry and my chicken was on the verge of being a weapon it was so overcooked and dry.  Both sauces had 0 flavor and the maduros were extremly dry. All in all I do not know what all the fuss is about subpar food and an extremly rude waitstaff and manager mean I will never go back	1.0
O.K. we have come here a few times and each time it seems to be less interesting the next. They do not take reservations - they don't have to. This place is always busy. The sangria's are great cause you can add your own poison. The ensalada miami is the best little refreshing salad I've ever had. Not many times I can rave about a salad. This salad is one my husband can enjoy. The empanadas are good. The seafood paella was my husband fave dish but guess what he has said that each time we've visited the dish has good smaller and the taste has slightly changed - and no banana leaf. The pollo a la plancha is good, not great bu good. The armando's beachfront grill is a baby back rib and it seems like more fat than ribs. The first time I ordered this it was baby back ribs now it seems as if they are short ribs, Overall, we have taken many out of town guests here and they like it because it is like a party type atmosphere and they get swept up in the frenzy. But, for us locals or people who know this type of food it is good fun place to visit.	3.0
This place is incredible it is a favorite of myself and all of my friends if you have not tried it you must.	5.0
When this place first opened, I was here all the time. Slowly, but surely, it fell off. And it continues to just disappoint. Not sure if I will ever return to be honest. To give Cuban Pete's the credit it deserves, they have an amazing Cuban setting. Palm trees, coconuts, paintings, even the uniforms, all add to the Cuban feel. But then the noise level kicks in, and you realize, you can't even hear the person infront of you. The music is extremely LOUD, so people naturally raise their voice, so it almost becomes unbearable. Anyone who knows me, knows I am a loud person; for me to say that is just weird. Then when there is a birthday celebration (which there are many), there is even louder banging on drums and a group of men singing in spanish. The food is just lacking. Nothing amazing nothing to brag about. Apps are good, I would say theyre better than the actual meals. Steak was over cooked, Ropa Veja had no flavor. The bacon wrapped dates were really good tho! Our server was nice but, we couldn't order our apps without placing our entree order at the same time. What?! We were starving and werent ready for meals! We felt like that was almost rude... I get it may be a way for them to expediate their table turn around but than are you thinking of quality or quantity? Thanks but no thanks Cuban Petes.	2.0
the cuban food here is amazing! . b.y.o.b.	5.0
Stopped by here when visiting New Jersey to try some Cuban food for the first time. The entrance was confusing... had no idea where to walk into the restaurant. It had palm trees everywhere and as you walk in, you had to duck down to get inside... Odd... otherwise you would be smacking your face into some palm trees. Honestly, the palm tree arch should have been taller or the trees should have been separated a little more in the entrance.. Upon arrival, we had no idea where to go.. We had to walk to the middle of the restaurant to get seated... Most places have it at the entrance. I was definitely super confused.. Alright to the menu... it reminded me of a Mexican restaurant with a twist. I wanted to try the enchilado with jumbo shrimp, but they ran out of jumbo shrimp. Sad day. Instead I got rice with pulled beef... The food portions were HUGE and they were all served in clay bowls. The dishware was in the middle of the table in a vase. They also serve community beans with all the dishes. The food was good, but the service was subpar.. was so thirsty.. I was trying to conserve my sprite... so I could drink at the same pace I was being served.	3.0
Fun atmosphere, good food, great music! A nice break from the usual american, italian.... restaurants.  Will definitely go back.	4.0
The food here is delicious but beware of wait time on weekends.  They also do not take reservations so it's first come first served.  We waited roughly an hour and a half on a saturday night.  All that aside, the food was fantastic.  Also a great atmosphere, but not for those who like a quiet dinner.  There are many large parties here and it's also BYOB so there are many loud people.  Overall, the food is great and the atmosphere is fun and exciting.  Definitely a must try!!!!!	4.0
I like the place, I'm actually giving them a 2.5, but I'm rounding up to 3 because of the potential it has. I won't ever come back though, due to the many negatives I will list. Let's start with the ambiance. It's nice and very festive. The place definitely stands out among other restaurants on the same street. The entrance is really cool, you're surrounded by trees. It's like you're walking in a forest or jungle. It can get annoying if you're tall because you need to duck, but for all my shorties out there (me included), we're good. Once you walk past the trees though, it's wild, not in any good sense. I came here on a Thursday night, pretty late too, around 8 pm. So naturally, I expected the place to be pretty empty. That was not the case. The place was PACKED, way beyond capacity. All the seats were filled and we were forced to wait half an hour for a table. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that there's no waiting area whatsoever. No matter where you stand to wait, you're always in the way. Always. There's just no way to avoid it. We were seated in half an hour as promised. The server tried the best that he could, but honestly, he had so many other tables to look after that he wasn't too attentive. Could be a sign you need to hire more staff, just sayin'. The worst was when we paid with our credit cards. He just took the check and didn't come back until a half an hour later. Now, I'm sure you're all wondering about the food & drinks. We all shared a pitcher of sangria. It was delicious and fresh, but where's the alcohol? They could've put grape juice in there and it would've been the same. As for the food, it was really good. I ordered the pork with rice and fried plantains. Everyone at the table pretty much enjoyed their food. I don't think it was worth the price I paid though. I know of better cuban places with cheaper prices and higher quality food closer to where I live. Also, it is sketchy walking around in Bloomfield at night. I don't mind homeless people, but when they're walking around yelling and screaming, it can get kind of scary. I haven't even seen that happen in Manhattan or in Queens (where I grew up). If you don't want to read this entire review, here's the short version: Food is good, but not worth the price I paid. Sangria is fresh and tasty, but barely any alcohol in it. No waiting area. Staff not attentive; they need to hire more people Decor is really nice. They have live music. When I say that, I mean servers banging on drums and hitting utensils against metal cups for about 30 seconds. Yeah. Huge potential, but unless they make drastic changes, won't be back here again.	3.0
The food at this restaurant might come with a wait.  My girlfriend and I first came to this restaurant because of a recommendation from a friend. We were greeted by a large group of customers waiting around the hostess.  When we asked her how long the wait would be, she said 45 mins.  Time went by slowly, partially due to all of the amazing food passing by you as you wait for your table.  We eventually got seated in the crowded dining room.  Our waiter took a little bit to get our order because he was over whelmed with the other customers he had.  But when the food finally came out, it was absolutely delicious. My fiance had the ox tail which was tender and fell off the bone and I had the roast pork which was full of flavor. In conclusion, we have come back to this restaurant because the food is that good. However, we never go during busy hour.  We normally go for lunch or an early dinner. We are seated right away and the food is just as good.	4.0
If you're checking reviews for food, the food is great.  But the overall experience brought it down to a 2.  My complaints don't stem from an isolated incident, yes I don't find value in those reviews either.   Come early and be prepared to wait.  If you wait, there isn't really a waiting area.  The waiters and waitresses are constantly on the move and you just end up being in the way.   The place has a nice feel to it.  Authentic west indies furniture and setting.  They play music every 15min to 30min but it can get excessive.  Now there must be seating for hundreds in this place.  It gets very, VERY loud.  I don't know why management desperately needs the revenue, but you can tell they do.   The ticket time was about 30 min and that's beyond my range.  Our waiter took very long between taking the order,serving, and collecting the bill.  I don't blame him because the place seats an absurd amount of people.     The food brings redemption.  Great drinks, great menu, and great tasting food.  It is all a bit pricey however.  If you like rice,beans, and plantains you'll like it for sure.       i'd like to give this place a 3, but these prices make me give it a 2.  The cheapest  entrees start at $15.  I'm in the Bloomfield side of Montclair. If I'm paying these prices my experience should be well beyond this.  I can get better quality and experience in NYC for these prices.   TL:DR Great food, but high prices and lots of waiting will leave you annoyed above all.	2.0
Really good spot for dates or even a small outing with your friends. BYOB-they sell mixed juices and drinks for you to mix your liquor with. The food was served pretty quickly, but it did tale awhile to get the dessert and get our bill.NO reservations at all. ON a weekend youre probably gonna be waiting for awhile. Siting outside is nice, but it can be a bit stuffy. Coconut rice is delicious. the spinach and cheese empanadas are amazing. Deff one of my faves ive ever tried. I wasnt too crazy about the goat cheese nuggets, they need something else inside of them..way too much on the goat cheese. The cod fritters were good, especially for $4--youll get about 6 little balls of fish. if you dare to make room for dessert--get the tres leches. it is absolutely amazing!  i was in love with it.	4.0
Some of my prior review stands. It's overcrowded.  It's not really Sangria--though the concoctions are quite tasty. The tight quarters and hustle/bustle makes service difficult--though there's no real excuse not to stroll through a few times to refill water glasses. Having rethought it, you really do get quite a bang for your buck. I'm not sure if things have changed or if I simply misjudged it in the past.   Two adults and 2 kids for $50-60 is a decent value. Is it outstanding, authentic Cuban food?  I wouldn't go that far, but you'll certainly get a good meal. Big crowds and seating play a pretty big factor here. No reservations, so you may have a long wait--especially parties of 5 or more. The lack of waiting space, and a host stand at the center of the restaurant make navigation difficult.  To and from your seat, to and from the bathroom. Couple this with tight seating, and you may find yourself getting frequently bumped or jostled by patrons and staff alike.  Pick your table or seating position carefully...	3.0
Wanted to find a good place to dine on my birthday and a random google search landed me here. Assumed it will be a small place but was blown away from entrance to the dining to the after effect of the amazing ambience with string lights, al fresco dining, live drum beat music revving up the feel, and energy packed summery place! Felt right on the Cuban planet and didn't feel like I was in jersey for those few hours. Great service, delicious tapas, amazing place! Best in montclair!	5.0
I am a first generation cuban and I must say I love this place. The food reminds me of home, which I don't get to visit working so many hours. When I want to treat myself to a great meal when I am missing home this is the place. The only down fall, the wait is insane during certain hours. The place is a BYOB location so don't order drinks expecting them to have any. As for the quality being use to home made drinks they are average.	4.0
Cuban Petes is the kind of place where I believe people come for the atmosphere. It is beautifully decorated inside and the outside seating area is gorgeous.  You enter by walking thru what my friends jokingly called "the jungle." Immediately you're immersed in a chaotic, yet warm, and somewhat traditional atmosphere. Warning! This place gets packed like nothing I have seen in NJ!  My journey to the restroom felt somewhat like a sabatical! Despite the crowd, service was remarkably fast. It is also very loud.  Good for groups, bad for a date.  It is also byob. As for the food I got the Chicken Carlitos way.  The chicken itself was nice, tender, and juicy! The seasoning was a bit sweet for my taste.  If not for my personal tastes in food, this place is easily 4 stars. I also had the manchengo cheese and spinach empanadas which I enjoyed.   I think I had different expectations for cuban food. Ive had a lot of food from other latin cultures, which is more spicy rather than sweet. But my cuban friend assured me the food was prepared mostly traditionally. Overall I say go here for the experience and the friendly staff.  Grab a bottle and go.  Just be prepared to shove through the crowds!	3.0
Everybody in Montclair talks about this place, but i really cant see what has special :/ the decor is pretty caribbean also the ambiance is warm perfect to forget a little about the horrible cold weather. But the food was not that impressive. The portions are huge so u can share between 2, but flavorful? Ehh not! We ordered some lechon asado, (pork), with rice and beans. It was tasteless and dry, my husband had to order some salt and pepper. I think this is not authentic cuban food, it just a sparkle of it. Maybe we didn't have luck that day, or was too early for lunch.	3.0
Literally my favorite restaurant in the entire world. I've eaten there about 4 times just this summer it's so great. I usually get the Ricky Ricardo's Ribs which are boneless short ribs in an apricot sauce. It's reallllyyyy good I love it. It has a sweetness to it and it's just all around really good. It comes with rice and black beans and Yuca which is a latin potato which is also very good. As for the tapas I've had the chicharon de pollo which is just chicken lollipops. They're really good but can be a bit salty. I've also had the chicken empanadas. Now I've had homemade empanadas from various places and I can't say these are the best ones I've ever had. The drinks and flavors are great but it is BYOB and they'll mix sangrias for you. The atmosphere is very fun and the waiters are very friendly. It can get a little crowded especially in the winter when the outside isn't open. Most times you'll be pretty close to people next to you so the restaurant does get pretty loud. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the noise level with the people and the music can make it hard to hear one another. But overall it is a wondering restaurant and I genuinely enjoy eating there.	4.0
I've been to cuban pete's twice.  I got a sandwich the first time; it was pretty good but nothing special.  I liked the crunch plantains that came with my sandwich a lot.   The second time I got the pollo cubano, it was flavored really well.  The garlic sauce was delicious.  However, the chicken was seriously dry.  I barely ate any of it because it was just really unappetizing.  The rice and black beans were good.   I also had the watermelon sangria, which wasn't strong at all and tasted really sweet.  I enjoyed it though.   The ambiance is fun and the entrance way made me feel like I was entering into a restaurant in Cuba.	2.0
I loveeeee it here! Ropa Veja & coconut shrimp are the best! Bring your own that can be mixed into a sangria or mojito! Street & meter parking. The owner is a doll and always accommodating! Fun lively Saturday night out kind of place !	5.0
Amazing ambience, always packed. Super hard to find a table but its a must go to if you want an amazing cuban experience. Food is decent, didn't meet expectations, but was still good nonetheless. Would recommend.	3.0
Good food Reasonable price Good customer service Great ambiance Loud but fun Expect to wait on weekends Bring red wine or rum Bring your friends or family Parking behind the place or at Fullerton for $5	5.0
Absolutely love this place! Service it's always so so for me whenever I come but the food is so delicious that I don't give a rat's ass. I always go with the churrasco as my staple since its so flavorful. The portion they give is nothing to sneeze at either, though. If you ever find yourself hungry in Montclair, this is a good option out of all the many other great food options around. Heads up, it's byob do make sure to come prepared.	5.0
The ever so busy Cuban Pete's has surely established themselves as one of the easily crowded restaurants of Bloomfield Ave., but for good reasons. This review isn't just from a first time visit, but from countless times we've eaten here and the food is truly good. I usually get the Cuban Pete's paella, which comes with a decent amount of seafood, while my boyfriend gets the Rabo Encendido (oxtails). The food comes in a good portion and if you want you can always ask for a side of chimichurri or churrasco sauce. This place only gets four stars for two reasons, one being that the ambience is actually something I don't appreciate. The music is jarringly loud to the point you can't even hear yourself talking. Two, this place quickly becomes disorganized during weekend nights. Overall, great food at good prices, but I would suggest you to go on a weekday afternoon or night if you don't want to deal with the weekend crowd; trust me it's worth it.	4.0
I love this place. It is such a cute place. I love the walk up on the side of the building. The food is always good. It can get loud, especially if there is a celebration. I went there during an engagement situation. They were too hype. Anyhow, it is BYOB and a always enjoy my food. Always!	4.0
I m here every Sunday , I love this place.  Good food , service is good too , they get pretty busy on the weekends after 4 thou .. Over all very nice ... The ambience is cool , palm trees and Cuban decor .	5.0
When I was younger I used to go to a small Cuban restaurant near my home but it closed down a couple of years back. I've been searching for authentic Cuban food ever since and then I came to Cuban Petes! Food is delicious!! I ordered Rabo Encendido aka Oxtail Stew. It was mouthwatering. It came with rice, black beans, and plantain. Not only are you enjoying exquisite food but the decor makes you feel like you're walking into a tropical island. The waiters are dressed in guayaberas (mens shirt popular in Cuba) with their fedora hats which adds to the cool tropical island feeling.	4.0
Great food, mediocre service, way too loud, bad parking situation. The food is phenomenal though. Fun for parties.	3.0
Not good for date night. Music was SO LOUD which caused neighboring tables to talk LOUDER. The best part was the waiter shouting over our table to ask if our neighboring table needed more hot sauce. Really? Food was pretty good, but I felt rushed to order and rushed to finish, so it took away from it all. The waiters moved so quickly I was afraid to move or I'd be whacked in the face. Ironically, it took forever to get our check.	2.0
I psyched myself up about going to Cuban Pete's because I had never been there but heard ALL about how great it was. I really enjoyed all of the food, which was very good...from apps to entrees, it was all on point. You really have to be in the mood for this type of experience...for example...waiting up to two hours for a table while standing on top of other people waiting and people eating....so loud you can't hear the person across from you....open air seating which means no AC so the room we dined in was HOT (I hate sweating while eating)....you screaming your order at the server (since it's so loud)....getting rushed like cattle in and out so they could turn over the table. Our server was super quick to take our orders, tell us apps/entrees all come out together, and throw us our check when we declined dessert. Again, none of this bothered me because I knew what to expect from reading fellow yelp reviews...like I said, it's an experience. I would def go back on an off night/maybe lunch so I can relax and it's not totally insane (like on the weekends). Def give it a go!	3.0
Go, go back, then......go again!  One of the BEST Cuban restaurants in the tri-state area.  Did I mention you should go because you should.  Try the coconut rice instead of the plain white rice.	5.0
Last month I had friends visiting from out of town so brought them straight here for lunch after picking them up from the airport. As always food was on point & delicious. They loved it.	5.0
Atmosphere is cute.  Definitely a loud place though.  Don't expect to have deep, meaningful conversations here unless you're willing to lose your voice. It's a BYOB - beer and wine only.  We brought a bottle of rum to add to the mojitos and the waiter told us it was technically not allowed.  I'm thinking they shouldn't even do mojitos or sangria bc they're not that great.  They taste like a bottled mix that is incredibly sour (the woman next to us said her sangria was overly sweet also). The food was tasty and reasonably priced.  Things worth trying:  chicharron de pollo, bocaditos de sandwich cubano, the croquettes and anything with their coconut rice.  S'gooood.	3.0
I found Cuban Pete's to be a fun place with good service and the food was ok. It's a cool place to hang out with your friends. This was my first visit and I shall return. Well, I give this 3 and a half bow ties out of 7 the food was okay, but it was not the best Cuban food that I have had.	3.0
Great place, it's byob. Music it's always loud so be prepared to speak up. Has great outdoor seating, good for bday dinners. Food is always good. This particular time our waiter took way to long to take our order, check on our meal plus dropping off the check. It was a pain having to hunt him down and we felt like we were bothering him.	4.0
Overall, Cuban Pete's is an overrated restaurant. If you want to have quality Cuban food, I suggest that you find another restaurant in Union City or Paterson. The food at this restaurant was nothing spectacular, and the price to portion ratio is not justified. I had the Pollo Cubano which was suppose to be boneless according to the menu. The chicken was too dry for my taste and half of the plate was plantain. Least to mention, I was given the cheap parts of the chicken, leg and thigh. The restaurant has to lower to their prices or increase their portion size in order for me to find the value of going to Cuban Pete's. On a positive note, the wait service was good. Although the food took a while to be served, the waiter was very nice in attending to our needs. Also, the ambiance of the restaurant is quite unique in which you feel like you are transported to Havana. I believe that Cuban Pete's builds a lot of hype from the fact that they are located in a trendy neighborhood of Montclair. My recommendation for people thinking about going to Cuban Pete's is that it is a nice place to have a good experience with your food. However, do not come in with high expectations with the food itself!	3.0
Food is outrageously great! So is the wait for a table sometimes. LOL Do yourself a favor and order "to go" when The line is long. Calling ahead is a real time saver, but it's pretty quick when ordering in person, as well. Service can be spotty when they are too busy, which is often, but I gotta admit that I dream about their beef stew. It is just like my Abuela used to make. Big tender chunks of flavorful meat with just the right amount of fat and potatoes. Served with rice and black beans, and maduro (ripe, sweet fried plantain). Yumm-friggin-y It's so good, we haven't had anything else on the menu since ordering the beef stew. Liquor store nearby. BYOB. Fee for uncorking/BYOB'ing. They must give a free dessert if it's your birthday, because there was at least 20 in the few hours we were there. ID check, anyone? It almost became my birthday too! (If only I weren't full) Other good stuff: stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Empanadas. Whole Red snapper. Parking is the only challenge, but it's worth the walk. Entering the place is like being on a tropical vacation. Great decor!	4.0
There are literally hundreds of reviews for Cuban Pete's so I'll keep it brief - bottom line, this place rocks. That's why you'll find such an insanely long wait time on the weekends! My advice is to stay near the hostess desk while you wait - you just might find yourself getting seated earlier than expected (has happened to me probably 4/5 times I've eaten here). Definitely bring wine for sangria (white or red works) or rum for mojitos. They have a very upbeat, party atmosphere so it's always loud in here. Not good for a first date or deep conversation. Perfect for celebrations, girls night, and medium sized groups. I feel like you can't go wrong with the food but my favorite dishes are the masitas (omg, literally dream about these), rip tips, and bacon wrapped dates for appetizers, and the vaca frita or lechon asado for entrees. I've obviously never been to Cuba but the food seems pretty authentic to me. Give it a try during the week if you want to avoid waiting. Also, the owner is an awesome guy if you get to meet him. One time I was eating with my friends and he brought over a huge (free) dish of vaca frita in some kind of a tomato sauce, and said "here you go, it's good to try all kinds of Cuban food!" and left it for us. He helps to get people seated faster when the wait is crazy too, which is really nice.	5.0
My boyfriend and I LOVE the food here at Cuban Pete's. We've gone twice so far. The ambiance is fabulous and so much fun. Not only is it decorated like Cuba, but there are live band members walking through sporadically playing authentic music! Both times I got ropa vieja with white rice and beans, and sweet plantains. It's also great because you can bring your own boos, which we do. The food is DELICIOUS. My boyfriend is Cuban and he is with me! I highly recommend! Side note: There is always an hour-long wait, so put your name in and THEN look for parking (which is hard to find). The first time we waited *one* minute over and the owner gave us and 6 other couples $50 gift certificates! It was so nice of him! He is awesome.	5.0
I'm sure you already heard this place can have crazy wait times for a table and unfortunately the rumors are true. If you can tough out the wait time, the light at the end of the tunnel is some of the best pound for pound, dollar for dollar cuban food in the area! I always reccommend starting a meal here with the masitas: crispy, meaty, fatty pieces of pork; and make sure you squeeze some lime juice on them. For an entree you can't go wrong with the lechon asado; roast pork with plenty of garlic or vaca frita: braised beef fried with onions and peppers (again squeeze the lime on this one!!). The accompanying rice, black beans, and plaintains are the real deal here too...good luck staying low carb here. Wash it all down with your beverage of choice you bring from home or the liquor store next door. They'll make pitchers of sangria with your wine or pitchers of mojitos with your rum. Service can be hit or miss but is generally pretty good for how insanely packed and unorganized the dining area seems, like i said if you have the time to stick out the wait for a table; you'll enjoy your experice here.	4.0
Cuban Pete's is a restaurant that is mostly all about the ambiance. Some may say it is almost like you feel you are really in Cuba. I believe they did a wonderful job in bringing forth such feel. The waiters all wear matching Guayabera's and some with straw hats. The food is just a bit good but not great. I am Cuban and I have had much better Cuban food BUT they do have a few dishes that are definitely worth trying. Their churrasco is amazing(my favorite dish here), papa rellenas are good, and the ropa vieja is okay. I wasn't to crazy about their roast pork and their croquetas were meh... too small. Other than that I have not tried any of their chicken or seafood dishes, I will have to go back. It is BYOB. You can bring your own alcohol for mojitos and your own wine for the sangria mixes they have. Which by the way the sangria mixes are very very nice, I did enjoy it.  Whenever it is someone's birthday, all the waiters get together with bongos & guayos and start to sing happy birthday, it is very fun and entertaining. I must point out though, if you go there on a weekend be prepared to wait at least an hour or longer to be seated.	3.0
The only place ill eat at on Bloomfield ave in Montclair.  Cant get enough of this place.  I've been here many times and most of the time I stick with the crispy beef because its so good and I dont want to miss out on havin it when I go.  The sangria is top notch very flavorful.  It is a byob so if you plan on drinking while eating get it from the liqour store down the way.  The staff are very polite but if you go at a busy time for the establishment it doea get loud.  I would comment on the desserts that are offered but im always to full to try them whenever I go.  If the desserts are anything like the rest of the food ordered they'll taste great too.	4.0
Cuban Pete's is my favorite restaurant in Montclair, a place packed with great places to eat. There are several reasons why Cuban Pete's is a cut above the rest, however: the ambiance, the food, and the service are all at 100%, every time I've been. My only gripe is that inside the volume of the music is much too loud, but other than that this place is perfect. I would recommend sitting outside since it's summer, if you can get a table without waiting an hour. The wait is worth it, however, because eating outside makes the experience that much better. The wall of waterfalls is really cool and beautiful and the waiters always look sharp and are nice and attentive. Their tapas menu is excellent and always tasty, specifically the empanadas, cuban sandwiches, and the ham coquettes. I tend to stick with the Lechon Asado, which is garlicy, slow-roasted pork goodness. I've also tried the mango chicken which was excellent. The sangria offerings are also tasty, namely the Spanish Harlem. I once brought a bottle of Bacardi, which the waiter kindly mixed with the perfect juice made of guava, pineapple, and papaya. It was amazing! Good times were had that night. Overall, despite the crowds and loud music, Cuban Pete's is a one of my all time favorites for incredible Cuban cuisine, amazing service, and the beautiful ambiance.	5.0
Really excellent food and fun atmosphere! It's BYOB, don't forget, but apparently only wine and beer. We brought a handle of Captain Morgan's and they said it wasn't allowed. But they turned a blind eye to it and said we could hide it under the table. A couple other tables around us also had hard liquor and it didn't seem like a big deal. So, you can probably get away with it too. I've only been here once but I could see how this place gets SERIOUSLY packed especially on weekends. Apparently, you can't make reservations either. We came with a group of 7 at 8:00 on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. So, just keep that in mind. The tapas are small and cheap and since there were 7 of us we were offered the family style portions. Chicken empanadas, beef empanadas, chicken lollipops, goat cheese fritters and platanos relleno. We ate ALL of it. The goat cheese fritters and the platanos relleno aka plantains stuffed with queso really were the best of them all. For my meal, I got the chicken con mangos which was very good! The coconut rice they serve with it is SO good. Everyone else at my table got skirt steaks of some kind. I tried it and it was very good. Also, one person got the pulled pork which tasted better than it looked. Not dry at all, lots of garlic and other flavors. As far as the service goes, it was a little meh. I understand because this place is very busy. The servers are legitimately running around the place and working as hard as they can though. Also, we went on a really hot day, I think it was 94 degrees that day and when we arrived at 8 at night it barely cooled down. We were sweating profusely while sitting at dinner. There was no air conditioner in the room we were in so that totally sucked. Other than that, this is a great place to be. I recommend everyone try the house hot sauce they have here. It's not spicy but it's very flavorful.	4.0
Food here is always amazing. It makes up for the long wait. A group of 7 of us went last night (Thursday) for a birthday and had an awesome time. Had handsome Greg as our server. He is da best. The only reason I took a star off was because the shorter host with a ponytail. She was not so friendly and made my friend feel some type of way for asking how long the wait would be. A smile wouldn't hurt girl. Still we love cuban petes and we'll be back!	4.0
Overrated. Atmosphere is cool for a group of people. Empinadas very very dry service sucked cause there were 10000 people there on a wed. But if u want excellent Cuban food I suggest city tavern in Elizabeth NJ..	3.0
I have been coming to Dom's restaurants for years now. Excellent Cuban food, particularly then tapas, at very reasonable prices considering the location on Bloomfield Ave in Montclair. Service is always great and the food consistently good. The décor and music add to the experience. I prefer to sit outdoors when possible as you feel you are almost in Havana. I know the big draw back for everyone is the wait. I could tell you how to get seated quicker but I don't want to wait, sorry.	4.0
Finally got the chance to try this place for a family member's birthday. Got there at about 8pm on a Friday night, hostess said there was an hour wait, but we ended up getting in in about 30-45. Perfect atmosphere for group outings, but wouldn't recommend it for one on one due to the noise level. Great outdoor seating with salsa, bachata, meringue blazing in the background. Loved the idea of BYOB and the ability to mix it with their white and red sangria juices and different mojito flavors. (There's a liquor store a hop and a skip down the block if you forget to bring. Great Cuban tapas selections to try from. As far as entrees I think the Pargo (fried whole red snapper) is a must. Definitely was great, but I love any whole fish to be honest. Only complaint was the wait staff seemed a little rushed, but I can't blame them due to the amount of patrons were there. Grab a group of friends and roll out for a good time. PACK THE LIQUOR!!!	4.0
Went on a Thursday night and the place was pumping... Great atmosphere and good vibe throughout the entire restaurant.  Started with some bacon wrapped dates followed by the skirt steak with a side of some sick chipotle sauce... Food was dynamite... Service was awesome too, our server Greg took great care of us and was on point all night, thanks again Greg!!  Can't wait to come back.	4.0
The food is so dam good my family and I keep coming bavk for more. Good to try and go for an early dinner cause the evening gets pretty packed but for good reason!  Must try the flan its the best!	5.0
This is an amazing place for Cuban food. We ordered 7 different variety of tapas which were all delicious. The dinner was AMAZING. We ordered the Churrasco Al Gaucho (Skirt steak), Shrimp Empanado, and Garden Paella and everything was perfectly seasoned with great flavors. Even the punch was amazing (though non-alcoholic)! Now for the down sides: --It is extremely loud. Most of the Cuban restaurants I've been to generally have a louder ambiance, but this one went up to 11, possibly because the seating area is smaller and packed in with tables. (So definitely not a place to bring a first or second date if you're looking to talk.) --There is always a wait, sometimes as long as an hour and a half. We went on a Wednesday night and it was 20 minutes -- not too bad but still odd for the middle of the week. --There is no real waiting area so while you're waiting for your seat, you will get bumped into from all directions. Pretty annoying. --They do not take reservations and all of your party has to be there in order to be seated. So despite all the cons, the food quality definitely makes up for it, I highly recommend.	4.0
I totally love this place! I've been here several times. The food is great and the atmosphere is always festive!!!! It's byob but I don't even mind that because my rum mixes great in there mojito mix, lol!! The gentleman who runs the place is awesome.  He makes you feel at home! They have caught lightning in a bottle!	5.0
This place is authentic but very loud. You can't talk much with your dinner friends. They said the churassco steak was  the best but it was just o.k.  My husband said his mango chicken was good. Its a bit of hype and i would not rave about it to friends.	3.0
I recently visited this place for the 2nd time very long time ago and not remembering why haven't been back. Now I know why! The service SUCKS! OMG! The food is good for decent prices, very loud and unless you want to be pushed shoved almost get hit with a plate by a server then go. Won't be back sorry now I remember..LOL	3.0
I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is delicious. Last night I had a great meal there. We sat outside and felt like we were in Cuba the whole time. The waiter made us pineapple sangria and suggested some really good appetizers for us. We got the chorizo, empanadas, and garlic shrimp to start. Then we both got the churrasco de gaucho. Everything was fantastic. The chorizo is seriously addicting and the other two apps were great as well. The churrasco de gaucho is great because it comes with spicy chimmichuri sauce. The portions are huge and the prices are fair. I will definitely be back again!	4.0
PROS: This place has great food for decent prices. It's a very festive atmosphere and almost makes you feel like you are in Miami. I say Miami because I've never been to Cuba. Lol. The male waiters are a nice treat since we're all accustomed to having waitresses. CONS: They don't take reservations. The hostesses are sometimes rude. Since it is almost always packed in there, the minimum wait is usually a half hour. There is absolutely no waiting area. You're basically waiting in the middle of the entrance as waiters come and go w/ food trays in their hands. Their so called "Sangria" choices claim to have 5% alcohol but really you need to bring your own bottle of whatever to spruce up the Sangria. And lastly, no parking. Street parking is available or nearby lots where you will need to add some change in the meter, unless u find some spots in the neighborhood. All the cons aren't enough for me to give this anything less than 4 stars. It's still a great place to dine because no matter what you are in when you walk in there, you will definitely be in a happier mood when u leave.	4.0
The popularity of this place puzzles me. I feel like it's one of those places people feel like they are supposed to love and overlook the crap food and annoying ambiance. A hundred other better places in the area.	1.0
Great staff! Great food! Great atmosphere! It was an overall amazing experience for my first time being there. The only thing is that they don't serve alcohol but they do allow you to bring your own wine and they will mix the sangria for you so it wasn't that bad. I would highly recommend this place, it's such a lively and upbeat place to take a group. They would surely enjoy themselves. :-)	5.0
Stopped by on 07/06 in the Evening time for some dinner with my wife and a friend. There is always plenty of staff hustling and working hard to clean tables and service all the guests. The owner himself was present and with all the people that were there he took a few minutes to talk to us as I had asked him a question. I had the Ricky Ribs which were amazing. The tapas style menu allows you to order small dishes to try which were all really good. You can bring your own wine, and they will add it to their punch to make you Sangria.	5.0
I've been to this place several times with friends and always liked it, but I hadn't been for several years until my grandma just invited me out to dinner. We went on a Sunday night expecting it to be empty, but there was about a 30 minute wait. They were so kind though, and seated us right away because they realized my grandma couldn't stand for that long. Despite the crowd, they had great service. We had the most delicious watermelon mojitos, and the half pitcher was more than enough for the 2 of us. We got some empanadas and goat cheese fritters for our appetizers, both delicious although it took a while to get them. Then our main courses came shortly after, and were AMAZING. I got a whole fried red snapper, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Each came with hearty sides of rice, beans, plantains, and yucca. Needless to say, we were too full for dessert but wished we could try it, because I'm sure it would have been nothing short of excellent.	4.0
We were a party of 12, were seated immediately, but waited a good 45 min for the waiter to take our drink order. Food was ok, service sucked, noise level very loud, we were a mixed crowd young and middle aged couples, and everyone couldn't even carry on a conversation without yelling, and this was a Tuesday night..	3.0
Amazingly prepared food, wonderful music, albeit canned, and very nice service staff. Not sure if they ever offer live music, aside from brief interludes played by some of the waiters. Would be wonderful if there were live Cuban bands sometimes.	5.0
My Mom recently moved to Montclair so I surprised her with a visit on sunday afternoon and we decided to go here. The atmosphere is really cool and exciting. Definitely not a place for anyone who is bothered by loud music because the place gets loud. The only downfall was walking through the restaurant. It was jam packed inside and out.. there isnt much room to get by which was kind of annoying. The food is outstanding. I had the shredded beef "ropa veija". Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. The pitchers of drinks are good but a rip off since theyre $15 with barely any liquor. Definitely bring a bottle of wine to spice it up and get your moneys worth. Overall this was a great place and I will be returning soon!	4.0
Probably the best cuban restaurant Ive ever been to! Been there 20-30 times. The owner/manager works his ass off to make sure he meets everyone's needs. For starters- Empanadas, Mini Cuban Sandwiches and Chorizo are Amazing! Appetizers are small plates but 2-3 will be plenty to start. Entrées-Churrasco and Ropa Vieja are Amazing! Very good size portions on the entrees. Lastly the Spanish Harlem sangria is probably the best sangria ive ever had. Bring a cheap bottle of Red wine to mix though!  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because this place can get so packed sometimes you will be waiting a long time. Also theres an older waiter there who is just an ass. Told the owner about him and he acknowledged and apologized and said he'd take care of it. Offered us a free dessert. All other waiters were friendly. Definitely one of my top restaurants in Jersey!	4.0
Love this place! I must warn you its always packed so your pretty much guaranteed a wait. Its well worth it though. The environment is great you would think you are in Cuba. The food is so good I've never been disappointed. The appetizers are perfect because you just get a small plates worth so you can still have room for dinner. Its byob. And the outdoor seating is perfect when its not too cold or hot. Overall a great spot.	5.0
3.5 Experience: I've been to Cuban Pete's quite a few times before my most recent visit and I must say, I'm not as pleased with it as I was after my past visits. I went to the restaurant with my boyfriend. We arrived a little before 10 Friday night ( I think it's the only restaurant on the strip that stays open super late). we didn't have reservations - HUGE MISTAKE. The "party of 2" wait was about 30 minutes.  After giving the hostess my name, we packed on the stairs with a party of 16 because there was no where else to stand! It may seem like Service: Quick, to the point, but very friendly and polite. The manager was also a great help as well. He cut down our wait and made sure that we were seated within 20 minutes even though we had indoor seats and a 4-person table lol (4 seats) Food: Unfortunately this time, the food didn't do it for me. It seemed sort of over-cooked and over-salted. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the large crowds that were flooding the restaurant but I must say, It wasn't as good as I'd remembered it. My boyfriend and I both got chicken dishes. Mine came with a side of white rice, beans, and plantains and I must admit, the plantains were the best part Regardless of this rating, I'm going to go out on a limb and blame the food on how crowded the restaurant was. Every time in the past that I've gone to this restaurant I've gotten quality great tasting food! So I'm still recommending the restaurant to whoever is interested. I'll be back again to give Cuban Pete's another shot!	3.0
I salsa'd  into this little slice of Havana with my extended Puerto Rican family 2 abuelas 2 sobrinos mi mamita y los suegros. The owner took care of us like we were family rapidly made room even though it was packed, and sat us within 5-10 min. The ambiance was crazy Caribbean. So don't come to ponder the universe.  This is culinary equivalent of a nascar race loud crazy and fun!   The food was flavorful and plentiful. The prices were reasonable and the staff attentive. Dos thumbs up!	4.0
I love this traditional, great tasting cuban food! It's a little bit crowded sometimes and you have to wait for a table but is worth it My favorite dish is Rabo encendido (Braised oxtail in spicy tomato broth) this dish delicious!! Not to mention they serve one of the most delicious flan I've ever tried	4.0
Amazing authentic Cuban restaurant with the most delicious food ever! I'll definitely come back here. The atmosphere all around is just awesome. Great for summer.	5.0
I came here with a group of 5 on a Friday night and it was packed out the door (or the tree laden pathway to the back).  It's clearly a place for large families and groups to come together and celebrate life. The energy was palpable and the hectic atmosphere somehow meshed into a delicate and constant flow of satisfied customers and hungry patrons. Given how busy this place is, it's unfortunate the service level will sometimes slip, but these waiters really do their best to make everyone get the things they need. We found the beginning service up to ordering was fine. Then the wait for the food (which I think took around 25 minutes or so).  I can't even imagine the madhouse of a kitchen they have either. The food here is huge in portions and great for sharing.  We got the tapas, but wound up not having too many of them because our main plates were already plentiful.  I had the skirt steak medium rare and spicy.  In general, I love the skirt steak cut because it's perfectly tender and has these delicious natural striations that cut easily.  It was well seasoned and tops the tenderness scale at a steakhouse. This place is BYOB, so ... BYOB (clearly). Their punch is raved about so it's definitely worth the try.  I also found the price point to be comparatively inexpensive. We ordered a lot (way too much as you will too) food and wound up paying around $28 per person for a group of 5.  If I'm in the area, I'd certainly go here again (slightly earlier to make a reservation).	4.0
Dinner out Saturday evening. 5:30 and the place is hopping and for good reason. The garlic shrimp were done to perfection and smothered in savory garlic. The beachfront ribs were some of the best I have ever eaten and the shredded pork lechon Asada was brilliant, well seasoned and done to pork perfection. Cuban Pete's is a home run . If you have never tried Cuban food... This is the place to do it.	5.0
LOVE the food, and the BYOB Sangria. The only problem I have is the music is so LOUD. We were sitting in the main dining area in the back of the restaurant. The music was so loud I couldn't hear my friend. I asked the server, if he could get the manager to turn down the music, he looked at me, and shook his head, and said, "I only serve tables." Once more patrons started to arrive the host turned up the music more.EEEKK! Thank god we were done with our meal, everyone was walking out, and wanted to sit outside due to the music.	3.0
Honestly, it's not even worth a star but in order to make a comment I needed to rate this, idk what you want to call it! It was that bad. First of all, we waited for about an hour and a half.. Yes I said an hour and a half! Aside from being annoyed, pushed around by staff and the crowd, we were told about five different times that we were next to be seated.. Wrong! We even noticed groups after us go before us! Then  we were told to go in a different room and waited the remaining 30 minutes there.. Not only are we furious at this point but it was super loud, we were packed like sardines in a can, it was hot and I swear if I wasn't starved I would have left.. Finally we got called only to be seated in the back of the restaurant, it was beyond loud that I could barely hear what the girl next to me was saying, let alone the ones across from me. So I figured Alcohol is going to be the only solution to this night, wrong again.. My waiter (wish I remembered his name), took a year and a day to bring it to me, oh mind you the rest of the drinks and even FOOD was brought out at this time. Literally, the WORST place on earth, and I go to many places. Not sure if it just wasn't my night, but it isn't even worth me going to back to for a second chance.. Not even if the food was free!	1.0
LOVE this place.  I've been plenty of times.  Good atmosphere,  music,  cute servers haha.  Oh and the food is delicious.  Be warned on the weekend it gets packed so try to rsvp,  weekdays are nice too.  Has indoor or outdoor seating.  Like most places in Montclair it's byob.  Sangria has less than 1% alcohol but there's an alcohol store next door if you want to add to the sangria.  I've tried adding Grey goose coconut,  run or wine all are good.  For food I love the seafood paella or skirt steak (their churrasco)  with coconut rice.  Tapas are yummy	5.0
Cuban Pete's has a unique atmosphere that you can't really find anywhere else in the area.  Its perfect for a young crowd looking to have a little bit of fun.  If its nice out, definitely try to get the outdoor seating.   The tapas are where its at - try the chicken lollipops!  The sangrias are also a must have - I recommend Armado's Passion.  I have actually never been impressed with the entrees.  When I go now, I usually grab a sangria and some tapas instead and am much happier.   The HUGE problem with this place is that they don't take reservations and that the wait is often insanely long.  It seems that they are pretty much always busy	4.0
I usually get the ox tail or the fried pork chunks. I think they are pretty pricy for Cuban food so I only really go there when friends ask otherwise I go to other more moderately priced spanish restaurants.	3.0
In my opinion, definitely not worth the hype. If this was a normal restaurant without ridiculous waits, it might be closer to 4 stars. Yes, the environment is very energetic and fun, but also way too loud for conversation (luckily we were seated in this random table set apart from the rest of the dining room so it was a bit better). The wait was not bad, but we went on a Sunday evening. We were told 30 minutes but it only turned out to be about 5. The sangria mixers were disappointing. 13-15 dollars for essentially juice. I knew there was no alcohol beforehand but, but at that price I was expecting some really good mixer. Food was pretty good and not too pricy. My paella was well cooked and there seemed to be a lot of other good options. Service is fast and efficient, but be careful walking around as there are always servers carrying hot plates or glass running around.	3.0
This restaurant was absolutely amazing! We arrived at around 645 on a Sunday evening and the wait was about 40 minutes. There were so many people waiting for seats that people were piled up on the stairs. The decor of the restaurant is fun-- and the music is extremely loud. We ordered the garlic shrimp and chicken lollipops for appetizers. The garlic shrimp was very garlicky- just how I like it (however, there were only 5 pieces of shrimp). The chicken lollipops were also quite good. For the entree round, I had the churrasco which was the skirt steak with plantains and rice and beans. I ordered the steak medium rare but it came out more medium well. My boyfriend ordered the oxtail and rice and he loved it. The ox tails were flavorful and the sauce was perfect. We skipped desert because we were extremely stuffed from dinner. Overall, I would recommend this place but make sure you go early so you don't have to wait a long time for a table.	4.0
I do not think I have been ever so disappointed in the way the managerial staff has handled a Sunday supper in my entire life.  It was not just the service but the food as well.  We came together for a family gathering at 3PM and the place was swarming with no place to wait.  It was for my sisters grand twenty fifth birthday and for some of the family members to meet the girlfriend.  The table was ready, however the policy fool manager refused to let 7 out of the 9 of us sit, because two were on their way down the street.  We had an elderly grandmother with us who he placed in a busy corner, amongst a few other people that did not want to wait and stand around.  78% of a large table was there.  This just started the path to a disastrous experience at what used to be a decent Cuban restaurant.   Once we were finally seated.  It took another 13 minutes to get menus.  I bailed to go get wine to make this a more tolerable time.  Then 8 minutes after I return the waiter finally came to take appetizer and entree orders.  HE DID NOT EVEN ASK US IF WE WANTED WATER, not to mention any non alcoholic drink order.  It is 80 degrees out and you do not automatically drop water off?  That is the first thing you ask for. As for the food.  The tapas were actually good.  The Al Ajillo shrimp were the highlight.  Flavorful, but not to the point it burned your tongue.  The chicken chicharon tasted great with the cilantro mojo, but they were overcooked.  The bocadillios were very good and the meat was very moist and the bread was nicely toasted.  The ceviche was probably the worst I have ever had.  I was excited to have the triggerfish, but it was just limp and soggy with an awful marinade.  The tapas came out in a respectable amount of time.  However, the non-alcoholic drinks have yet to arrive an hour into our service  Then the waiter gets irate when I asked.   The sodas and mixes finally show up.  There are three bottles of white wine on the table.  He comes back with red sangria.  At this time, we were too tired to care and mixed it in wit the white wine.  The mojito mix was nice and refreshing.   My paella was hardly editable.  The fish tasted like it was delivered a week ago and bought at a Weiss in the middle of Pennsylvania some where.  The flavors of the seasoning just lingered around and were absorbed by the soggy rice.  The coconut shrimp was very nice and I am glad I was able to eat two, otherwise I would have left hungry.   As for my main complaint.  Stated above, it was my sister's birthday.  My mother who is mellow and compliant as can be when it comes to dining out asked for the birthday surprise and the manager assured her again and again it is quite lovely and will be out.  It never showed up.  She was very sad that my sister did not have a mini celebration.   In conclusion, the music, family and sitting outside was the only thing that made this place tolerable.  It was packed with people that came from Bloomfield and Newark looking for a nice place to eat.  The food has suffered since the last time I came here.  The service hardly did their job.  I rarely write one star reviews.  I never want a place to fail, but no one can handle the amount of people at 3PM on a Sunday.	1.0
I love Cuban Pete's. Alittle noisy and rushed but waitstaff is very friendly and efficient. Food is ific and drinks are well done. Ample off-street parking in back.	4.0
BYOB, great place, everything is excellent. always packed, arroz con leche is on point.	5.0
Me and my family went here to eat lunch after church, this place was amazing!! Foods were delish and absolutely fairly affordable! But, It was loud prolly because the next family seating beside us swallowed 10 megaphones!!!! The fudge!!! Manners please!!!!	5.0
The ambience here is just perfect, particularly in the warmer months when they have the outdoor seating open--the palm trees and music make you feel like you're on a mini vacation somewhere in the tropics. The food is sooooo good! Whenever I go with friends we usually forgo entrees and just order a bunch of tapas to split. My personal favorites are the chicken empanadas, the chicken lollipops and the chorizo. Their coconut rice is also delicious. As many others have mentioned, they are BYOB. They have several mixes available  that you can bring your own wine to add to. Their mojito mix is pretty good too, but the last time I was there we brought rum for it and were told we couldn't have hard liquor visible....so we poured it into our glasses under the table ;) I would give them 5 stars but the service here is not that great. I understand that they are extremely busy but each time I've gone the servers were not very friendly or attentive. Also, its VERY loud which I personally don't mind but some people might.	4.0
This was third time and Cuban Pete's and from a food standpoint it didn't disappoint. From the Sangria to the Tapas the food was great and satisfying. The place is loud and on a Saturday night it will be busy. Sadly what faultered on this visit was the service. While we got seated in about 20 minutes it went downhill from there. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Once we did nothing we ordered came out right. Our waiter either didn't speak English well or refused to understand us. Out of 13 tapas orders half were wrong. He kept bringing out the wrong dishes. Ass to that a fallen glass that got onto our coats and water that was spilled down the back of one of the four of us, we weren't happy. We asked to see the manager twice and it wasn't until I searched him out that we were able to complain. We even had to get our own plates. Cuban Pete's is a great place and fun. Sadly, last night was a bad experience for my party of four.	3.0
Good food, great service, noisy as all get out and extremely crowded 2 hour wait on Friday night for party of 5.  Make a friend with someone who works here tip them handsomely and avoid a long wait!!    This place is so crowded its a fire hazard for sure !	4.0
This place is an easy 5 stars. Great atmosphere, great staff. Usually always busy but it's worth the wait!!!! I come all the way from NY to eat here! Amazing amazing amazing	5.0
I love this restaurant. Very delicious and well seasoned food. Main problem is that the sauce was WAY too oily the last time I went. Chicken lollipops are delicious and fast service. Nice pleasant atmosphere.	4.0
This place is easily five stars, efficiency & great tasting cuisine is what Cuban Pete's does best. Went there on a Memorial Day weekend, place was packed but upon giving my name we were seated within 15 Minutes. Bring your own wine, they make awesome sangria. We stopped by liquor store few blocks down. For appetizers we got chicken lollipops which were succulent, I would def recommend these. Empanadas was our second choice, which were great too. My main course was the Naked Paella which was tasty, but my date got the churrasco steak which was amazing!! Large and thick slab of juicy grilled steak with sweet plantains. Didn't have room for dessert but I guess I'll have to go back and try again.	5.0
Pros- Cheap, consistently good food, BYOB (although the 2 liquor stores in the area know of their advantage being that this is a really busy place and DOUBLES their prices for ordinary wine _ BEWARE_) , sangria choices, atmosphere, outdoor dining, pure cuban feel. Cons- Waits, having to order everything at once, the rush in-between courses being that I like to sip on my wine and take my time. Ive seen the hostesses get snippy with people more than once, not myself, but others. That being said... This is a great business, the staff is great, and the atmosphere is outrageous! Definitely worth checking out.	4.0
I come to Cuban Pete's often being from the area. Co workers birthdays, rough weeks. I always get some vodka mix it with their Sangria since it's BYOB!  Food is always great no matter what you get. Occasional entertainment. I prefer to go during the week days I'm not big on crowds, either way great establishment.	5.0
LOVE this place. I dislike that it is always packed, but I see why! I have to come to this place for dates, birthdays and even business dinners and everyone is always satisfied. The owner is almost always there and is pretty friendly. I remember seeing him kick out a large group prior to them being seated, because they disrespected one of the service providers at the restaurant. Way to go! Why do I say this? Because he sets the tone that at the restaurant everyone is treated with respect and fairness. I have had the oxtails, red snapper, Arroz con Pollo, sangrias, and Tres leches. Everything is good and you can't go wrong. BYOB!!!	5.0
For ambience, food, and service. Never had a bad experience here. The only thing you need to remember is that you'll likely wait but it's always worth it. Having grown up on homemade Cuban food from mami y abuela this comes close. I recommend the croquetas, ropa vieja, ensalada tropical, tostones con pernil, sándwich cubano y pasteles de guaba con queso	5.0
Ya know, I have to say this place has been lacking over the past year. My last visit to Cuban Pete's was about 3 weeks ago and it just left a bad taste in my mouth. It took TWENTY minutes for someone to come over to our table to even acknowledge us. I understand this is a big restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, but you should have enough staff to cover all tables or at least acknowledge all parties in a timely manner. But anyway, the food quality has slipped a bit. They may be using the same menu, the same ingredients, and the same cooking methods, but it's just not as good as it used to be. The skirt steak is always cooked well, the sweet potato and rice that comes on side has been COLD the past 2 times I've visited. I'd love to give Cuban Pete's 4 stars, but it hasn't lived up to its potential recently.	3.0
come prepared with a xanax and ear plugs!	2.0
Went here tonight for the first time. It was definitely good. Don't forget to BYOB. Luckily there's a liquor store a few doors down. Party of 4- two people had ropa vieja (which was really good because I tried it), another person had one of the chicken dishes that looked pretty good and I had the churrasco which was awesome. Even though they didn't cook it as I wanted (medium rare, came out medium well) it was pretty good. We also had a few of the tapas- a cheese one, chicken lollipops and empanadas. All were pretty good, decent prices for the small we portions. The worst part I would say was the service. The service was just really slow so don't be in a rush to eat and get out when you go here. While the server was nice, he randomly came over. This place was pretty busy and tightly packed in there, but still, took like 15 minutes to come back to get the bill...and this was on a Monday night. Good atmosphere as well!	4.0
Unfortunately this is one of those situations where the place is so busy, the service level slips a bit. My biggest pet peeve of dining out is being rushed. And they will rush you here, big time. The food comes out way too fast, the busers will ask you at least 10 times if you are done and don't worry about asking for the check. Do not rush me, yo! It's rude. Also, the last time I was there, our waiter seemed overly concerned about our BYOB situation. Apparently, you are not allowed to bring anything that vaguely resembles sangria cause they will be all over this. (They want you to pay to buy their mix-in) And I guess a bottle of home made wine and a bottle of Fireball (yeah, Fireball. It was a birthday gift) look like sangria. We were questioned about this twice and actually asked to put the Fireball away though we never planned to open it. Look, your establishment is BYOB, so I can bring whatever the hell I want to bring to drink. This is half the reason your place is so popular, so don't harass your patrons with stupid questions about whether we are trying to make some sort of underground sangria or not. Dumb. So yeah, food pretty great, ambiance super fun but the service is pretty bummy.	3.0
5 stars, I love this restaurant! The food is always great and the atmosphere is always festive. Outdoor seating feels like you are dining in Cuba with the palm trees and the music.	5.0
Better ambiance than food and service. Cuban Pete's looks really nice-the back patio, the inside is pretty nice as well. However the poor service and food is taking it back. The waiter I had took over 15 minutes to take my order (being that the restaurant was only half full we were disappointed) and other problems such as drink refills were late as well. On a better note the food is pretty good. We started out with the chicken lollipops (great appetizer) then afterword got the flank steak. The steak was really chewy and not cooked to the right color as I asked. Also the rice it came with was hard and tasted as if it was made a long time before being served.	2.0
Not a fan, this is NOT good authentic Cuban. My rice was hard and crunchy and this place like a sweat shop for the amount of people they try to stuff in here. I'm sorry but this place is completely overrated. There is way better Cuban in North Jersey, since we have the  second highest Cuban population in the US besides Miami metro area . The wait staff was nice and is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars. The crowd is filled with people that you can tell are somewhat ratchet and are trying to prove they are "upper class", I'm sorry but starting a fight with your waiter and talking loud saying "I'm from Newark, don't mess with me", isn't exactly classy. Besides, the food sucked. Try Havanas in Hoboken or the Cuban. Or there's a few good ones in North Bergen as well. I'll never go back	2.0
I Love Cuban Pete's. I have never had a bad experience here yet. I had my daughters 16th birthday party here it was great!! The food is delicious and the staff are always so friendly.  If you enjoy food with lots of flavor try them! It is also BYOB	5.0
Place is amazing, just had some red snapper from there that fell off the bone. Literally, grabbed it by the head and was able to lift the whole spine with no effort off of the meat. Place gets crowded because it's such a hot spot but the food is top notch, atmosphere is amazing, and the waiters/waitresses are all really helpful. If I had to recommend one dish, I'd recommend them all....	5.0
The reviews (good and bad) that I read are very consistent with my experience.  Fun place with great food!   It was a little overcrowded and the music was way too loud.  That forced the conversations to be even louder.  We were definitely rushed and moved out quickly.  My server was poorly trained. It was noticeable and annoying.  However, I'll be coming back.  I really liked it!	4.0
BYO and pretty loud, but all around great place. Wasn't too impressed with entrees, tapas are definitely the way to go. Goat Cheese fritters and beef empanadas are great!	4.0
I have been here numerous times and they never fail to provide excellent cuisine and great atmosphere. It's BYOB and the sangria is outstanding. The wait staff is very attentive,  I dropped my fork and before I picked it up, I was given a new one.The Happy Birthday song is entertaining,  but when played more than a few times, its a bit much. As long as the service stays at this level,  I can put up with the song. I also love that the owner is present and greets guests warmly. I felt like I was at this man's home. Awesome!	4.0
600 plus reviews need I say anymore. Had the chicken stew it was awesome came with beans and plantain. The stuffed peppers were good as an appetizer . Loved the mojito a must have! Just get a glass instead if a pitcher if you are going alone	5.0
I came here after my cousin's graduation and wow I was impressed. The only flaw was while we were waiting to get seated along with others we had to wait by the steps which caused an annoyance to many people including the workers who worked there. Other than that the quality of the food was amazing. If you haven't been here, I suggest you go. Did I forget to mention BYOB?	4.0
I love this place.  I found it back when I was in college and have been a fan for years.  The portions have always been big but there apps seem to have been reduced in size. But no matter what the food is delicious and always sends me home in a food coma!!!	4.0
I absolutely love this place! Anything you get here is simply delicious. The staff is lively and friendly and everyone had a good time going. Downfalls are its very over crowed, and noisy. Otherwise this is a great place to eat big portions of food for a great price, and drink their many famous sangria flavors. Or BYOB. Ps- the sing an awesome lively birthday song	4.0
Food is EXCELLENT. Food is the only reason to come here. Its BYOB, so keep that in mind. Also, dress code? There isn't one. Some girl was walking out after eating wearing sweatpants, headband and sweatshirt. But it is SO loud in there. Just ridiculous and loud. Talking to the people at your table is near impossible. And our server sucked. He was awful. Took over 10mins to get a glass of water. But some of the other servers looked like they were doing well with their tables. Also, super crowded. Definitely, go for the food. Beyond that, meh.	3.0
Cuban Pete's is good, not great - definitely a mixed bag. While the BYOB is a big plus and the food is very good, the service has consistently proved to be below par and the average wait time for a table here is just stupid. Whenever I want Cuban Petes, I have to take several deep, soothing breaths to convince myself that the person to person waiting room will be worth it. No matter when I have gone-- winter, summer, night, day, there is literally ALWAYS a freaking wait to get in here - and understandably so, but it is still annoying and detracts from the experience as a whole .. To be positive, the atmosphere literally makes you feel like your on vacation with hanging lights and actual palm trees galore. The servers are in traditional light yellow linen outfits and it's a cute touch. Onto the food - The goat cheese tapa in honey is the best thing you can order, but all of the other tapas are around $4 and delicious as well. For a main course I usually get the lechon asado (pernil, rice beans and maduros) and its delicious. The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. My only negative here, and it's a big one, is the quality of the service and the wait time. I've seen the person who I believe is the owner several times, but he always generally seems pissed off, over his head with the amount of people waiting, or is sometimes pleasant to only certain people whom he seems to know personally...Definitely a frustrating aspect, but if you can look past it, It's definitely a great restaurant and worth trying (just be prepared to wait and wait...)	3.0
I've been here a few times in the past and I must say the quality of the food is well worth the wait. Lucky for me I've never gone with more than two people so I've been seated rather quickly. Because of my previous positive experiences, I decided to celebrate my birthday here last night with a small group of friends (a couple even traveled from Queens). The waiter insisted that we place all our orders at once, which wouldn't have been a problem if all the food didn't come out at once. As expected, the food was great, but unfortunately everyone had a tough time enjoying the tapas because they rushed our plates out of the way to fit the entrees. We spoke to the staff about the rushed service and they apologized, but at least six times throughout the meal the servers attempted to clear our full plates away. For food that is prepared this good it would have been great to have the opportunity to actually enjoy it. If I was basing my rating on the quality of the food, decor, and atmosphere I'd have definitely rated them higher, but having good food that you barely get a chance to chew is pointless no? A huge part of the dining out experience is service, which last night left a lot to be desired despite his included gratuity. We also noticed that the servers were preparing other customers beverages at adjacent tables with the liquor provided, but out server did not and he didn't even offer napkins and water until we asked. Pretty disappointed in the latest experience.	2.0
Each time I've been here has made me want to come back. Be forewarned that the music is pretty loud (louder than I would've liked). There is usually a wait, but the food is worth it. Everything I've had here has been really good... I love the papitas rellenos (fried mashed potato ball with ground beef in the middle) as an appetizer. The churrasco that comes with rice, beans and plantains is to die for. In addition, the portion sizes are very large. I usually end up taking half my churrasco home for leftovers. I've tried several of their sangrias... They are all really good, but don't forget to bring a bottle of wine or rum for them to add it to the sangrias.	4.0
Update: Came here a second time and stood as the manager seated people he knew while everyone else was told they had to wait an hour. Also called half an hour ahead and was told there was no line. Never coming here again. The food here was spectacular. Wanted to give it 5 stars but here's why I'm only giving it 3. The wait took about 2 hours and consisted of having to constantly check with the hostesses repeatedly rather than having your name called. They need to figure out a better system than two rude and dismissive high school girls with a bad attitude and a clip board. No organization whatsoever. Stressful environment to be in especially when the place is so overpacked with people waiting to be seated. We were finally seated when a manager overheard how long we had been waiting. You practically have to fight your way to the hostess stand. The servers were great however. Attentive and very entertaining. Oh and don't forget to bring your own wine if you go. You pour it into the sangria mix they provide.	1.0
I have been a repeat customer of Cuban Pete's since it opened.It's such a beautiful place full of life, wonderful food, wonderful staff--great atmosphere.  I found Lillian M.'s review of 4/25 particularly disturbing and confusing.While my experiences with the staff have always been great-everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I just don't understand why the woman you were with felt the need to say her "husband is a state official".  I would also take that as a threat-I think many people would.  What bearing does that have on the situation?  What difference does that make?  The guys who work there are great people..I am sure that statement made them nervous and uncomfortable.It was a really unkind thing to say.  Then in your review you tell them you work for a newspaper!!  This is almost a form of being a bully--If you weren't happy just talk to them about it--no need to threaten!!  Your review has not changed my opinion of how great Cuban Pete's is--I will continue to go-and judging by the fact of how busy they always are---I think a lot of people feel the same way I do.	5.0
Restaurant is really good. The service and staff are very friendly. Food quality was amazing and wait for the food was short. Ropa vieja taste amazing. Highly recommended	5.0
Besides the wait and sometimes how loud it can get cuban pete's does it right ! All there apps are great a little small is your with a big party but you can just order a few and its like tapas . The main courses are generous portions no matter what your get here you wont be disappointed. They have chicken fish beef and pork options and i have tired them all and enjoyed each one . Some of my favorites are the mini cuban sandwiches and all the empanadas for apps . Main courses the shredded beef ( forgive me not writing the names in spanish i can barely spell in english !) and the garlic pork is so good . Its a byob and they have so many different sangria  flavors and mojitos as well. So know your going to wait its busy and loud but the food is excellent and we keep coming back.	4.0
I'm only giving this place 3 starts because it's not worth the 2 hour wait. I went here during lunch hour on a weekday so that I knew we wouldn't wait. I do love that it's BYOB and they will make some great Sangria for you. In terms of food, we started off with their empanadas de queso. They were really tasty. Their chicken empanadas were also good. I have had their goat cheese fritters before and I think that's one of my favorite dishes of theirs. Anyway, we all ordered the pollo cubano to eat. Tasty dish but I can get the same thing at any Cuban or Peruvian restaurant. Pros: The ambiance is great. You really feel like you're in Cuba. Their outdoor seating area is also super cute when it's nice out. Cons: Always packed. Food is not worth a 2+ hour wait and the waiters will rush you as they want to serve everyone.	3.0
This place was pretty good. I enjoyed the food, which was reasonably priced with generous portions, and the sangria was pretty delicious. The atmosphere was nice and there was a nice outdoor seating area which would have been great to experience if the weather was nicer. My only complaint was the service. Our waiter wasn't very nice and we felt rushed through the entire meal. Someone at my table, who was still finishing off his food, even had his plate taken from him when his head was turned. I'd come here again but it wouldn't be my first choice in Montclair.	3.0
What a great place! The food is delicious, prices are great, and it's BYOB. You can't beat that! I loved the atmosphere, crowded but inviting. I'll definitely be back here again.	5.0
FOOD--AMAZING, decor, music and waiters uniform makes you feel like you are on vacation in Cuba. The music is loud which some people won't like. BUT PLEASE PLEASE GET A LIQUOR LICENSE ASAP, the " jug of punch" menu is so great all it need is alcohol. many people do bring their own wine or vodka to add to the punch but life would be so much happier for customers and the rest. if the alcohol would just flow there hint hint.	4.0
Food is EXCELLENT. Very flavorful, but be advised that if you are not used to eating food with salt, or 'just a dash' of salt, you may think the food is salty. I ate a few things off the tapas menu and they all had a salty base sauce which I love. I'm not saying the food is TOO salty though, just throwing that out there it may be like that for some. I had to take two stars off for the spacial arrangement of the hostess stand, and the hastiness of the servers and waiters. We walked in the back entrance and walked down the steps (which were lined with ppl on both sides leaving space for only one person to fit down. Definite fire hazard but whatever) to put our name on the list. Told it was an hour wait. In the 30 seconds we were down there we got bumped and blindsided by the servers moving extremely fast through crowds with piles of plates which was SO annoying. The hostess desk clearly is not in a good place but there really is no where else for it to go bc the place itself is pretty small. We went back up the stairs lined with ppl and joined them. Our waiter was alright. I mean they were busy so i know he was trying to move fast and what not but i dont think that should be at the cost of friendly customer service. They also ran out of a few items on the menu which disappointed me but i get it, it happens. I'll go back but never on a busy night. Maybe a Monday night is better?	3.0
I gave this place another try having eaten here in the past and not being impressed. This meal was a lot better than prior times. Our wait wasn't as bad as we thought but there really is no system for putting your name in. The hostesses look a bit frazzled and over whelmed. They use a notebook to take names. People are crowed on the stairs waiting to be picked all while trying not to get run over by a server. Its a bit of a mess and there's definitely more efficient ways. Once you get past all that and get seated its fine. The servers are all very nice but extremely busy. They run around so much at times forgetting that we just asked for water, or hot sauce or our check. It's hard to get annoyed at that because they are clearly very busy but still its an inconvenience. The out door seating area is great. We had a beautiful night last night so it was great to eat outside. For apps we got the garlic shrimp and cuban sandwiches. For dinner the lechon and churassco. All were good. The lechon comes with alot of pork and I found the serving of rice to not be enough other than that I was pleased. Also. Its Byob so we brought some red wine and got the Cuban Petes sangria which was tasty. I think this experience opened the door for me to come back.	3.0
Well...I gotta say the coconut rice was the shit! ordered the ropa veja and it was sub par....I've tasted much better. Ambiance wise the place is cool....well for a Sat night...lively, packed and good energy. Expect a crazy wait on a good day, like over an hour. Overall a decent spot. Had to send the plates and wine glasses back cause they were dirty. Would I return. Sure. The coconut rice is THAT good.	3.0
Cuban Pete's has an excellent atmosphere if your looking to sit outside and enjoy the weather. When sitting in the courtyard area, you at times forget your in Montclair, the Caribbean style decor provides a very cool outdoor atmosphere. I ordered the Churasso, because I read many yelp reviews recommending this and it turned out to be very good. I would definitely give this a try. The sangria mix is the best I've had, and the placement of a wine cellar directly next store works out perfect. You will see a pitcher of this at every table. Unfortunately I cannot give Cuban Pete's any more than 3 stars because of the sub-par service received. I had ordered a few appetizers, and was told I must order my entree with this as well. I then asked the waiter to confirm that I would not receive both the appetizer and entree at the same time. He said of course, the appetizer will come first. We received the first of our appetizers and no more than 10 minutes later, before receiving all of our appetizers, our entrees came out. We then asked why we had received out entrees so soon, and before all of our appetizers came out, and we were told that they were out of the appetizers we ordered. It would have been nice if they told us, and possibly asked if we wanted something else instead. The food here was good, and I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere. I'm not a fan of taking to yelp to bash a restaurant, and that's why I saved the negative comments for last. I wouldn't say to stay away from Cuban Pete's, but due to the service I received, unfortunately I will not return.	3.0
I've been here twice over the years - pre-renovation and post-renovation. The food is great. We had some mishaps with the service the second time. The sangria is great, and the atmosphere is very fun, young, and exotic. You really feel like you're somewhere interesting when you eat here. The plantains I had at Pete's live on in my memory as among the best I've had. Oh, they were perfect, caramelized on the outside, sweet on the inside, pure of flavor. Yes. And the beans! Slow-cooked to soft, rich, thick perfection. That day - years ago, and I still remember all this! - I got a whole fried fish. Yes, I ordered snapper, and they gave me a whole snapper on my plate, with the eyes. It was delicious. I was so happy. I didn't know what to do about the head, so I ate it like a cartoon cat, leaving the tails and the head but stripping the middle to its bare bones. The second time I ate here, it was a beautiful spring day. We got in just as the crowd was starting and ate in the courtyard under a blue sky. It was a perfect evening. Unfortunately, this was post-renovation, so the tables were very small. We did not have room for our two dinner plates plus our Sangria pitcher. It was so crowded with tables that a waiter bumped into my husband's chair and spilled soda on the back of his shirt. Yikes. I don't remember the food as well from that visit, though I remember being satisfied. I will return here, but I would take someone for lunch on a day that is not crowded.	4.0
Great place with great atmosphere and food.  Inside though it can get loud.  It is byob.	4.0
We went here last night for a special occasion dinner. When we got there, it was jam-packed and we were told there would be a 20-minute wait, but after only about 10 minutes they got us a table. We brought a bottle of red wine for sangria (which tasted good, but one pitcher was way too much for the two of us), and decided to share tapas and an entree. The tapas came out pretty quickly - the portion sizes were good and they were all really tasty. We got the crispy chicken lollipops, the goat cheese fritters, the beef empanadas, and the almond-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. We split a Cuban sandwich after that. Again, tasty. So were the plantain chips. The final bill was about $50, including the tip. Very reasonable for a nice dinner. Yes, it's loud. It's REALLY loud. I have no idea why the music is turned up so high. It was fine for my husband and me, but we commented that we'd probably never bring a group of friends here because conversation would be impossible. And the busboys were in a pretty big hurry to clean up after us (which was good when we were trying to get the empty tapas dishes out of the way, but was a bit annoying at the end when we were still trying to finish off the sangria pitcher). They have an outdoor area, and if the weather was just a little bit warmer maybe we could've sat outside and it would've been just a tiny bit quieter (but not much - again, it's REALLY loud). But it's a fun atmosphere, the food was good, the price was right, and our waiter was friendly and attentive. I'd like to go back and I definitely recommend it to others, but just know your company. This isn't a place for a first date or with someone whom you want to have an intimate conversation with.	4.0
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times now and I always have a fun time and full of great food! The atmosphere is loud and lively, its a BYO, and the meals are very flavorful. You can't go wrong ordering the churrasco (go gaucho if you want a little extra kick) as an entree and the chorizo appetizer is phenomenal.	5.0
Went here on a Weekend. It was quite crowded but the overall layout of the palce is interesting. Several buildings connected by a courtyard. In the summer I expect it to be a great experience. The music sadly is really loud, they could lower that just a little, but overall the wait staff and ambiance was very good. We tried the  Empanda De Queso (decent, but you should like really cheesy food), Pernil Con Tostones (our favorite dish), Platanos Relleno (I liked it, though it has a bit of a sweetness to it, it is plantain after all), Chorizo Al Vino (I would not reccomend it unless you really like the dish, it is very plain and simple, not worth dining out for) and Cuban Pete's Paella (this dish was decent though it wasn't great and not super fresh, though Paella really isn't supposed to be, but I might try other entree's than this). Overall it was a good experience and good food worth considering if you are in the area.	4.0
Ok it surprises me how anyone could give this place a bad review. I loved this place! I've officially lost track of how many times I've eaten here but I've never had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always friendly and the wait once you're seated is reasonable but keep in mind if you go on a busy night the wait may be longer because this place is very popular.  This restaurant is extremely busy on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights so if you don't get there before 6 or 7pm be prepared to wait awhile to be seated especially if you have more than 2 or 3 in your group.  It is a BYOB but there is a wine and liquor store two doors down where you can buy what you want to bring with you.  The birthday celebration music that they play on the drums and maracas are fun to dance along with while they play.  I love Cuban Pete's food and my favorite dish is the garlic shrimp and for dessert the guava and cheese pastry.  Oh and the appetizers are delicious.  Chicken pops, bacon stuffed dates, goat cheese fritters, empanadas, the list goes on.  I love this restaurant and I will keep going back every time.	5.0
Stopped by as part as our daughter accepted student orientation @ MSU on a Sunday afternoon.  Yes the place is loud, there is very little room between tables, and you will have to wait a bit for your order...nothing different than a typical high volume restaurant, plus a Latin factor, and since you are here that's what you are looking to experience.  We enjoyed several of the tapas and were very please with the flavor and variety, the sangria's are very tasty and since its  a BYOB (wine store 2 doors down) you can "customized" them to taste. Great for a casual meal, great for a group,  not for quiet date. We are hoping for our daughter to have a successful four years @ MSU, we plan to stop by  Pete's often, when we are in the area to visit her.	3.0
Atmosphere is fun, service was great and the food was delicious..best skirt steak I've ever had.	5.0
Girls night out for dinner and drinks. Wine shop next door is a plus! Waited a few minutes to be seated. Very big space- though tables are pretty close so it's amusing what u can hear from other tables. Server was Javier! Attentive and fast, kept our glasses full. -Goat cheese app with honey YUM. -stuffed potato with beef- not bad - shredded beef and plantains very good. Dinner- we had skirt steak with coconut rice! So good I ordered a side of coconut rice! Minus one star for constant chair moving/ bumping in dining room. Worth the drive, they have an outside area. Ps- mgr Dominic was nice. Will be back!	4.0
Ok so I'm a fan of Cuban food, and the food here is good had a bunch of things loved everything. But that's not the problem, the place is loud, loud like you need ear plugs. And whatever you do don't go on a Saturday night they sing and play bongos at Birthday tables. Every 10 minutes they are singing to someone, last time I was there I asked to have my food packed up and left. My friends and I just cound not keep screaming over the loud music, birthday singers and Bongos. I've been I the summer for lunch and sat outside in the court yard and that was very nice, may try that again.	3.0
We went to Cuban Pete's for the first time in about a year. There was no wait for a table and they seated us in the small room across from the main building. The room was crowded and the music was too loud so people had to talk loudly to hear. We asked to be moved and were seated directly under speakers in main dining area. The music was louder than before. People were just about yelling at each other to be heard. We asked the waitress if they could lower the music and she said they could not.... so we left without ordering. Too bad because we like the food. After reading all the other complaints about the owner/manager and the music I truly believe he purposely sat us under the speakers because we complained about the music being too loud. Never going back. If you intend on going, bring ear plugs and DON'T complain about the music!!!	1.0
Absolutely love this place!! First time there and the wait was 5 mins for a rainy Sunday. The food was to die for.   I order a Vaca Frita and Jesus I wish I could eat that everyday. The Asian de Cuba Sangria was amazing, not to sweet but definitely full of tropical flavor. The decor is beautiful and I definitely appreciated the attention to detail. This may just have become my favorite restaurant ever!	5.0
Delicious as usual. I have the skirt steak like I always do and it seems to taste better n better every time. It's byob and they provide the sangria mix. One of my favorite dinning spots!!!	5.0
Everytime i am in montclair nj i always come here. Love the food it doesnt matter what i get its always good. They have music playing and great atmosphere. Great for groups.	5.0
I love this restaurant. The ambience and look and feel makes you feel that you are somewhere in the Caribbean perhaps Cuba. I have had several dishes at Cuban Pete's and I would have to say that their ropa vieja and churrasco steak are one of the top dishes to have. As a New Yorker I have tried many cuban restaurants and none come close to how delicious and inexpensive Cuban Pete's is. Another plus BYOB, bring some rum and make some sangria.	5.0
I'm giving them 2 stars b/c I like the atmosphere, but the food is nothing special. I had the pork & it was sooo bland. My mom makes way better food & even though I like the look of it...I'd never want to come back for the food. It was a disappointment to say the least. The icing was that it took 50min for our entrees to come out.	2.0
First time here, super busy place, great music playing. There were six of us so to avoid the 2 hour wait we sat outside which was fine. Food was amazing got the churrasco no rice with black beans and plantains. Yummy. Tried my Dad's pork which was good, garlic sauce made it. The only problem was the end, I think it took longer to get our bill and pay than it did to get the food and eat. Would definitely go again when I'm back in NJ visiting my brother.	4.0
First time here and it was a great experience. I definitely was worried about the possibility of encountering the angry manager (i know people that go into with him too)...but my experience was fine. I got there with two others but we had a total of 5 in our party so we had to wait. Although they said it was a two hr wait, the manager kept coming to check on us to see when the full party was there. He literally was walking passed everyone else and telling us "just let me know when the last two show!". While we were waiting we sat in the outside area and had some drinks, met a quirky couple...all laughs. Such a great time. We were seated within 10 mins of our friends arriving. They did give us an awkward table where one of us had to sit in the walkway BUT it was fine, he did his best to get us a table quicker than the 2hr wait. I had the chicken empanadas....yummm! The masitas de puerco....yummm! And the churrasco. Please get the churrasco!!! You will not be disappointed. I got mine medium rare...perfection! I'd definitely go back again even if the wait is super long.	5.0
We ended up at Cuban Pete's because it seems a lot of Montclair restaurants are closed on Mondays. First off, the server was confused about whether or not they had an item. Being on a time constraint and after he said yes then no - we needed to order another dish on the fly. He offered no suggestions. The food came out super fast, meaning its probably precooked. The food itself wasn't bad. The arroz con pollo lacked pollo & seasoning. The Carlitos way chicken was much tastier. As for the service, it seems we had the ONLY waiter in the building. He was slow. Actually slow is polite....as for the bus boys....seems that there was a plethora of them. At one during the meal, 3 of then decided to polish the the silverware around us very loud.  I had to stand up and walk across the restaurant for hot sauce. The flock of bus boys just stared at me like deer in headlights.	3.0
*oxtail (not bad; pretty tender but still not the best I've had; the rice was good and the plantains were the best thing on my plate; it was definitely on the saltier end of things); *chicharon de pollo (chicken lollipops; I actually pretty liked these; chicken was nicely cooked and seasoned; small servings but worth it) *empanada de queso (yum! small pouches of tastiness; manchego cheese with spinach, very savory and very good) I've been to this place several times over the past several years. They have changed owners and thus their menus. They used to produce better food before, but they still have good stuff. It's always packed and it's horrible waiting there. I think there's better food out there and this place is overrated.	3.0
Obviously my review isn't going to put them out of business- they are very popular, filling the huge space on weeknights and posting hours-long waits on weekends. But it just wasn't for me. When you first walk in, your impression is a cheesy, over the top fake Cuban Disneyland. Then your sense of hearing is completely taken over by the deafening Cuban music and percussion every few minutes to commemorate a birthday. The tables are crammed in, and they turn out an impressive amount of food with relatively decent taste for the scale of the operation. Our chicken ropa vieja was good but everything was obviously pre-cooked as it came out like a minute after we ordered. The portion was huge for the low price and we had a lot of leftovers. They didn't rush us as we lingered at the table trying to talk each other over the loud music. Eventually we had enough and left. If you don't like anything fancy or special, if you want lots of passable food for a low price, this place is probably good for you. It's a one and done for me, though.	1.0
This place has become a new favorite! I've had food from Cuban Pete's before but I actually dined in the restaurant for the first time last night. The atmosphere is fun and lively even on a Tuesday night. I can only imagine what it's like on the weekend. We got there a little after 8 but weren't seated until about 9. It was definitely worth the wait though. Our food came relatively quickly, which was a surprise. I had Armando's Beach Front Grill which is the baby back ribs in mango BBQ sauce with black beans and rice. It was phenomenal! The ribs were tender and flavorful as expected but even the rice was full of flavor and just "mmm mmm good!" I tasted the Isla De Pollo, which is also pretty good. And that time I had food ordered from there, I had the Bahama Coconut Fish and it was delicious. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the dishes at this place and the prices are pretty good for what you get.	4.0
Went on a Tuesday night, wait wasn't too bad. They were on a wait when I left at 9:15, nuts. Very very loud and hectic inside, watch out for the birthdays. I had the chopped pork dish which was ok, not much flavor and had to request hot sauce. The empanadas were good but super small and doughy. Likely wouldn't return.	3.0
A nice Cuban place located in Montclair, a definitely recommendation! Walking from the street, you enter by walking a little towards the back of the building, with all the decor to walk through along the way before entering.  It is a nice touch to have you enter into the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Once inside, you listen to more typically louder music to get yourself more into the mood of a Cuban restaurant.  Outdoor seating is great too when the weather is on your side as well. This place is BYOB so bring your drinks, and have some of their Sangria to start, I can say that is pretty good! For appetizers, my personal favorite is the Empanda De Queso, manchego cheese and Spanish empanadas.  It will not fill you up too much for your main course, and it has a nice taste to it.  If you going for some meaty appetizers, I would recommend the Chicharon De Pollo (fried chicken "lollipops") and Papita De Rellenas (beef and potato dumplings) as those I remember eating and being very scrumptious. As for the main course, my favorite dish here is the Churrasco, which is a skirt steak with spicy chimichurri.  You get a nice amount of food for the price and it is very flavorful and cooked right every time I got it.  A small modification of the Charrasco that I enjoy as well is the Charrasco Mambo King, which the sauce is different with a sugarcane mojito glaze.  Furthermore, if you are a fan of oxtail, you will not go wrong getting the Rabo Encendido, oxtail in a spicy tomato broth.   If you got room for dessert (you should, as most people do!) I have actually only tried the Tres Leches cake but I can tell you that it does satisfy the taste buds! As a note, they typically do not take reservations so it is first come first serve.  Cuban Pete's can get pretty busy at night so be on the lookout for that.  However, I do say typically because one time we had a party of 15 and they did accept our reservation.   They just seated us in a separate part of the restaurant where you actually do not enter the main restaurant and go into a separate "party room".  So if you do have a pretty large party, there is no harm in trying to call a few days ahead and see if you can get something reserved.	4.0
Every time we come here we get seated right away. Its always a pleasant experience. We love to park in the back and bring our own wine. We love eating here and then going to see a concert at the theater next door. It truly makes for a wonderful evening. If you have never tried cuban food then you don't know what you are missing. The sangria choices are out of this world! bring your own wine to make the sangria special! and they mix it for you too! but shhh dont' tell grandma!	5.0
I wanted to love this place, I really did. I live literally five minutes walking distance from here, I see the lines of people waiting outside when I pass by, and I was told endlessly when I moved to Montclair that it's a must try. Well I tried, and I was kinda disappointed. The ambiance is very lively, that's for sure. The servers are friendly and upbeat, there's music, the decor screams festiveness. It would be a good place to go hang out with a large group of friends, and I'd imagine that in summertime the outdoor seating area would be pretty dang nice. It is definitely NOT a place you should take a date however; it was so LOUD that I had to either scream to my boyfriend, or squeeze in a few words between transition phases of a song. Not really my favorite way to spend a dinner date. In terms of food, the tapas were amazing. We got the chicken lollipops (sorry, I don't remember the official menu names) and the beef/pork dumplings. I wish we'd ordered more, because the main course was kind of a let-down. I ordered the pan roast pork chops, and my boyfriend had the grilled pork chops. I don't usually eat plantains so I enjoyed the side, but the pork chops left something to be desired. The flavor was simply not there. In fact, I asked for hot sauce to dip my pork in so I could have SOME sort palate on my tongue (and I must say, the sauce was pretty good). Not sure we'll be back again. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.	3.0
Food is delicious and great for the price. BYOB is recommended. Stay away from the weekends place is RIDICULOUSLY packed. I went on a Wednesday and it was nice , pleasant and no wait. I had the grilled chicken, black beans, maduros abd white rice. Perfect.	4.0
Hello Everyone, I am not Cuban, however, I have been coming here on and off for a few years. The food is great and the service follows suit. I enjoy eating the Steak and Carne con Papas as a main course; the tapas are excellent also and my favorites being the chicken, shrimp and the pernil con tostones. The dishes a reasonably priced considering the location of the establishment and quantity of food. The place is well decorated and you can tell that a lot  of thought went into it. I read several reviewes on here regarding the loudness of the music and all i can say is that its been like that since i have been coming here and its part of the ambiance and the Caribbean experience. There are 3 dining areas and I encourage you too try all 3 during your visits and enjoy the view. Regards, Peter	5.0
The ambiance at Cuban Pete's was amazing. I think I was dancing in my chair the entire time. Our group brought our own bottle of wine & our server made it into Sangria - very tasty and a unique BYO option. I got the Gloria sandwich - it came grilled with cheese, pickle, onion and shredded meat (pork, I think). I would definitely get it again. My friends got the tapas - highlights: chorizo & fried cheese. The pear salad looked great as well. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and the place was hopping; there's a definite possibility that we would have had a hard time getting in if we had come at a more traditional lunch or dinner time. Long story short: I would definitely go again - especially if the weather was right for sitting on the patio!	5.0
AWESOME AWESOME FOOD. One downfall.... The crowd that goes is the definition of well......"ratchet" as you could call it.	5.0
If you're driving down Bloomfield Avenue you could blink and miss this place. It's located on a main street and in a pretty posh section of town. Here is what I like about this place. 1. the portions are great for the price 2. the meals taste like someone'e Cuban abuela is back in the kitchen with a head scarf on dancing to Celia Cruz while she prepares flavor for your mouth 3. It's a BYOB 4. I love what the waiter's wear (guayabera's and hats) What I'm not too crazy about 1. The wait is kind of long on a weekend 2. The restaurant itself is tiny; you need to shuffle through tables to get to the bathroom 3. It's BYOB and if you forgot to bring that bottle there is a liquor store a few shops down but their selection and price points are on the high side so if you really want that sangria you have to buy something there It's GOOD FOOD! The staff is great i've never had a problem. But it wouldn't hurt them to provide alcohol in their famous sangria blends. It would make life a heck of a lot easier.	4.0
Giving this place a 4 out of 5 starts. It loses 1 star because of the noise level and the fact that it is a BYOB restaurant.  We didnt know but there is a liquor store right next door to the restaurant.  So if you want to try the amazing sangrias or mojitos BYOB or buy one next door at the liquor store lol.   The Music was also  too loud when I went with about a group of six. It was difficult just to have a conversation. With the group we were with. If you are seated in the other section, you have to cross over to another building if you want to use the bathroom which is a bit annoying. But other than that let me get into the positives. Our bill came out to like $170-180 something don't quite remember for a group of six of us. We ordered 10 appetizers , 6 entrees, two soft drinks a pitcher of the classic mojito. Not bad and we ended up taking food home.  The food was absolutely delicious! You can have a nice mini feast just with the delicious appetizers  alone lol.  The entrees were great as well. I ordered the churassco with the mango sauce and my fiancee had ordered the chuletas.  Both were fresh, tasty and amazing.  The rice and beans were great as well.  They serve large portions. Usually maduros rice and beans and the meat  you order is a dish.  The paellas which two of the people that were with us ordered are big plates also. overall its a nice place to go and eat some nice cuban food and listen to some nice salsa music. if they turn the music just a little bit down its perfect.   The desserts are so good also.  the tres leche cake and flans are very very good.	4.0
During the summer you can sit outside and the Tapas are great. Again get their early  during the summer they are super busy.	5.0
Love Cuban Pete's! Been here many times for private parties, girls night out and dates. Love the food , love the music and staff. Sangria is great. Love that it's Byob! Everything about Cuban Pete's is amazing!	5.0
I got there pretty late and was part of a big group, but the host was nice enough to turn a table for 6 into one for 9. Unfortunately my top two meal choices were sold out, but the Red Snapper was my third choice and it was delicious. Everyone loved what they ordered. The sangria mixes were also very good, I'll definitely come back.	5.0
I liked the Ropa Veija chicken, Cuz liked Enchilado with shrimp. No alcohol but a liquor store three doors down. On to Ratdog at the Wellmont!!! Fred, you nearby? He he.	4.0
i will rate 4 stars only because the schematic's of this restaurant needs to get redone as people are bundled up like ants on top of each other when waiting to seat!!! the service however thats 5 stars the waiters are super nice and worth every $ they get! the food? well i must say if i lived next door to this place i would eat here everyday!  every single bite of my plate was worth it! super delish!! the party i was with ordered different dishes and all had good things to say about there plates! i would definitely comeback and order all the appetizer's! make sure to bring your own bottle of wine to go with there amazing sangria! overall a great experience just make sure you come here right after lunch to prepare your belly while its full for a long wait, but well worth waiting for. try not to use your phone as there isn't much space to use it. can feel like a subway :) CHEERS!	4.0
I mean there is a lot of hype around this place but it turns out it's just that ie hype.  We went on a night where we were able to get seated immediately but I'm told most days there are very long waits.  There is no way I would spend 2 hours waiting to be seated there.  It's not that this place is bad by any means.  The food is decent.  However it really is nothing to write home about a bit spendy.  It's BYOB which is a plus with a liquor store across the street.  The decor and service were fairly nice.  However it's also extremely loud even on the not so busy day we went there on. In short, if you can walk right in and have a hankering for Cuban food by all means go there if you're local.  Otherwise, it's not worth a drive or the wait.	3.0
Went here with the wife for a Valentine's outing. I had the "steak" Mambo King and my wife had the shrimp.  Food was EXCELLENT. Great atmosphere that took us to the islands and took our mind off the kids!  Music was great, service was prompt.  I highly recommend this as a spot to eat good food and get away from the typical Italian, Asian strongholds.  Get there before six to avoid the crowd	5.0
Amazing! I've been on a hunt for good spanish food in NJ for quite some time. I'm originally from NY and it's hard to find anything that can compare but omg we found it. Came Valentines day for dinner and the wait was 1 1/2 hours but we decided to wait it out because of all these great things we had heard. And we are so happy we did! The owner made the wait less horrible by talking to everyone and making sure they were ok. Of course there were some grouchy people who were getting impatient but they knew what the wait was so they should have just left if they couldn't handle it. Anyway, the staff was super friendly and the food was AMAZING!! Definitely worth the 5 stars and I can't wait to go back!	5.0
Sangria was pretty good and portions are big. It's always busy and fun here. For your birthday, they break out the conga drums. It's a fun time and the food is good. I was not a fan of the coconut rice though, it was too sweet. empanadas were eh also. The skirt steak was good and the ropa vieja is my favorite	4.0
This is the hottest, undisputed, hands down busiest Cuban (Spanish) restaurant in town. When they tell you it's a hour wait, they're not joking, if you get here after 6:30pm on the weekends, it's a 30mins wait for 4 or less, a hour for six or more, if you have more than 10pp, might as well stay home and cook your own. Don't try to tip the mustache, he's the owner, and he can be a little rude, the girls are easier to talk to, but helpless so save the flirting.  The wait is well worth it. Order the Churrasco, a must!  if I could, I'd order all the tapas. The food portion here are generous (except the tapas) and delicious. if you are deciding between a Mexican, Columbian, or Spanish night, I recommend you give Cuban Pete's a try. Place will be loud, filled with music and bootylicious ladies, it gets more urban as the night goes on. Parking will be a pain but there is a public parking garage and get here early on the weekends (before 7).  Aplausos!	4.0
I had such a great time here! Everything was great and I have no complaints except for the tiny empanadas. I liked the ambiance of the place: very lively and nicely decorated. I was upset that it was freezing and didn't get to eat outside along the palm trees. The steak was juicy and the chimichurri was good. I also liked the bring your own wine deal they have and the drinks they made were awesome. However, my favorite part of the experience were the bongo players to came to sing happy birthday ha ha.	5.0
Worst service ever. After they forgot my dinner and made me drive back, a half hour from my home, in a snow storm, they refused to compensate me. The hostess and manger gave me a nasty attitude when I requested that I be compensated for their mistake. Never have I felt so disrespected In my life. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business. I will never eat there again.	1.0
Americanized Cuban food. Much better than i expected considering the comical name of  of Some of the items like the Ricky Ricardo ribs. I tried some of every ones plate and everything was really good. As a Cuban I can recommend this place.	4.0
Authentic food, fun vibe, and great service! Can get loud and busy but it's part of the experience and worth it!	5.0
Awesome place, there is not a bad thing on the menu.  Place is always packed yet the service never lacks.  The mojito mix that they make goes perfect with Bacardi Limon.  If you're in the area, definitely stop in here.	5.0
This is my absolute favorite place. Good portions (by good I mean massive), but more importantly the food is all fantastic and always succulent. Byob option and affordable! Top notch. Please anticipate a very long wait. I normally would of given this place a 4 just because of how crowded it is and usually the wait is significant anytime passed 7pm. However, the restaurant and owner provides this information and makes you fully aware of the potential wait if you call ahead or as soon as you walk in. TRUST ME You cannot beat the food nor the price! The waiters are normally very very accommodating. If you're looking for a quiet romantic night out, avoid this place. If you are looking for a great experience, life to your romantic dinner night out or group dinner, GO HERE. It's decor is beautiful and truly feels like you're on an island somewhere. If you plan on going on the weekend the trick is to show up BEFORE 6pm. Don't let the energy rush you out though, they're a lot of people waiting to be seated but relax and enjoy yourself. The tapas options truly lets you try an array of options. If your ordering meat for dinner get some seafood taps, or visa versa. I cannot recommend a spot more than my all time FAVORITE Cuban Petes. If you are there during the week late and it's slowing up, expect the owner to pleasantly pop by. We've even gotten free sangria pitchers before! love love love this place. a MUST visit.	5.0
This is a place you must try at least once. Their food is authentic and absolutely delicious. Pros: Awesome atmosphere...for date night or a fun night out with friends Sangria is fabulous (BYOWine) Great prices and big portions Cons: Parking can be tough They don't take reservations The wait can be VERY long (but it is well worth it)	4.0
Chose Cuban Pete ' s for the reviews and to refreshen my salivating taste buds for Spanish food. We were awe struck with the speedy service, hard working staff, and the Rico menu options! The art and decor is one of a kind. The loud typical music makes for an enjoyable experience. The price was moderate with hefty portions provided. The appetizers were tasty which you will not find anywhere else! We didn't know what to expect upon arrival. Once we walked through the beautiful patio, we were enchanted! Tip to owner, do not increase prices, or change the cooks or staff!	4.0
Been here a few times. They always have excellent service. Only thing that prevents this place from being a 5 in my opinion is that they don't take reservations, so you can wait hours on weekends just to get a dinner. I think they also do this for show, to show appeal to people walking and driving by. Besides that one caveat, this place has great cuban/ spanish food and flavor, which should really appeal to everyone if you give it a chance. Oh yeah, the atmosphere is incredible if you like Spanish/ Carribean inspired music. No regrets here. I will most definitely come back.	4.0
I love this place. Get the Churrasco, it's the best value on the menu. In terms of the small plates, the mini cuban sandwiches, the empanadas, and the chicken lollipops are really good. Any of the flavors of pitchers of mojitos are the perfect accompaniment to the food.The food is fantastic as well as inexpensive. The cons are, it is pretty hard to move through the restaurant, since the paths through the restaurant are only wide enough for one person. Also, if you go on a birthday heavy weekend, bring earplugs as they do some very loud drum playing. I watched one birthday girl actually flinch. Even so, I would still go here pretty much everyday if I lived closer.	5.0
We went to cuban Petes at 6pm.  It is the best time to go less crowded. The music in this place is amazing the service is amazing. So when we got here the we decide to order chorizo Al vino and papa Rellena and papas De tostones. For entrée my girlfriend ordered the pork chops and I ordered the steak. It was amazing. We ate so much for appetizer that we couldn't eat anymore. Hands down one of the best cuban restaurants.	5.0
We went to Cuban Petes Friday, January 17th with a party of 16. When we initially arrived we were quoted a 2 hour wait. After about 30 minutes of watitng the manager came outside to check on us (I do not remember his name a gentleman about 5'6 with dark hair). We told him the wait would be 2hours and he told us he could get us inside faster than that, and he delivered his promise. We waited 45min and were seated (thank goodness for the party that didn't show up). They wait staff was very accomodating to myself and our guests. I love the vibe of the restaurant and foor was amazing, especially those empanadas! Thank you so much for making my best friend's birthday a night to remember. We truly appreciate you!	5.0
Great cuban food that is only overshadowed by an even better atmosphere.	5.0
I really enjoyed my experience here. We came during a Friday afternoon, so it wasn't super busy, but I hear there is usually a long wait to get in. The Cuba themed interior is great and authentic looking, not like a cheesy chain Mexican restaurant for example. I wish I could go in the summer because the outdoor seating looked so inviting. I ordered Hemingway's Pescado which was I think a mix of fish and crab meat. I also got a salad. The food was so fresh and they kept things simple, which was great. I keep thinking of Mexican restaurants where they slap a combination of rice, beans, meat, sour cream and salsa all on your plate and it mixes into one flavorless blob. I was so happy with the food here, and it all came quickly. Our waiter recommended Armand's Passion sangria, and it was delicious. I've never had a white based sangria, but this tasted like fresh squeezed fruit juice. It's only 5% alcohol so it won't get you tipsy, but I enjoyed it none the less. I'd definitely come back! Only complaint is the staff wasn't super friendly or inviting. I heard some of the hosts and servers snap at each other.	4.0
Went there around 11:30 on our way back to NYC, so I'm not sure if my experience there was due to the fact that the kitchen would be closing soon.   Gave it 2 starts for  these reasons 1) Hostesses were too busy having a convo with themselves to notice me.   Had to cut them off to be seated. 2 This place was RIDICULOUSLY loud especially when they do the "hbd" gig.  The worst place to bring a date; but fine for the  gf/bf .   3) Ordered the roasted pork with the yucca fries. It took less than 8min to come out, and was cold... Really regretting not sending it back. I believe it was an order that was sent back by another table. Oh, and our water glasses looked like they were used.   Disgusting! 4) Tables were so battered. Maybe there's a cuban connection with the tables so they don't want to chuck them, but they need lots of TLC In any case never going back. Nope, sorry Gary. - that was our very pleasant sever : )	2.0
Really enjoyed my visit to Cuban Pete's, but it could have been a little better. I went on a Wednesday around 2pm. My fiancé and I started off with the pernil con tostones and beef empanadas. Both of these dishes were phenomenal and I was really getting my hopes up for what the rest or our meal would ensue. I had ordered the churassco which is skirt steak with a mojo topping on it and my fiancé prefers some sort or meal with pork chops. She was very happy with her meal, but I was a little disappointed with my steak. I found it too be a little tough and hard to chew. All in all it wasn't a bad meal and I will be back. Maybe next time I will just order a bunch of tapas items.	3.0
Absolutely remarkable. If you don't eat here you are a moron.	5.0
I've been to Cuban Pete's a couple of times, once with a large party (18 or so) the other time there was just three of us, both times we had to wait an excruciatingly long time. While the food was good I would definitely say not worth the wait, especially not with so many other Cuban restaurants in the area. The ambience is nice, I enjoy the partial indoor/outdoor seating and the sangria is definitely a good selling point, however with so many people eating, the over flow of people standing around waiting and the music playing it is almost impossible to have a conversation with the people at your table. The biggest con is the fact that while the wait is always long there is no designated area to wait, kind of just wherever you can find space stand there. I'd recommend if attending someone's birthday or if you are invited, but if the restaurant choice is up to you, I'd say scroll right past Cuban Pete's.	2.0
Why is it so f'ing loud in here??? Literally have to scream to the person next to me. Ridiculous Above is my tip for this establishment. I wanted to come her to enjoy a nice meal with my friends for my birthday, and since I've always heard glowing reviews of this place so I decided to give it a try. Pros: *Good food- can't take that away from them. *BYOB Cons: *Deafeningly loud music. I have no idea why they insist of having the volume so damn high?? I understand you're trying to create an ambience but when I have a sore throat at the end of the night because I was trying to have a conversation in your restaurant, that is no bueno! *Parking's a nightmare *Cramped seating I also want to add that after reading all the bad reviews regarding the owner of the place, the hoodrat in me was hoping things would pop off. Luckily it didn't because I would have shown them how they do in Elizabeth. lol I would come back, but not for some time. My eardrums need to readjust after being blown out from the music level in here.	3.0
Hostesses were nice but had bad service skills. Fortunately the owner was there and he was extremely helpful and nice. Sub-par food.	3.0
I dined here Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed!!! The only reason why I didn't post 5 stars is because of the huge, long wait (no reservations) and I didn't like the (virgin) sangria - even with alcohol. It's BYOB, reasonable prices, delicious food, friendly staff, and a festive and fun atmosphere. It's a family restaurant and a loud place so it's convenient to bring the kids. The liquor store is right down the street. It makes for a fun Saturday night!!!	4.0
We went to Cuban Pete's hoping it would erase the "salt lick" experience that we had at Dos Cubanos. We were not disappointed. We had a big party so we ordered a fish, steak, pork, and chicken dish. All dishes were different (unlike Dos Cubanos where everything just tasted like salt) and the meat was incredibly tender and moist. Super duper good. Sangria (barely alcoholic) was great as well.  The place gets very noisy and busy during prime hours.	4.0
I don't usually bother leaving reviews for places with hundreds before me and undoubtedly hundreds after.  This is average Cuban food and I had to weigh in.  It's a fun place with fun music and I did notice everyone got a pitcher of mojitos so maybe it's the drinking but I didn't think the food was 4 or 5 stars.  I got the suckling pig with plantains and beans.  I did like the beans a lot, the plantains were good too, maybe a little greasy.  The pig wasn't really marinated in anything.  Parts of it were dry.  I like the fatty parts of which they included some but it just lacked some flavor.  It was just ok.  I didn't like the 2 top they sat us at next to the service station in the front of the restaurant.  It was really busy and there were guys milling around and behind me the entire time we were there.  It was really annoying.  Terrible table.	3.0
The vibe of this place, boisterous and energetic, with loud Cuban music playing, creates a party like atmosphere which I thought was really fun. We started with the tigerfish ceviche app, which was too sweet for my taste, and the only thing I ate that I didn't really like. The coconut fish was very good...sweet with the coconut and fried to perfection. I didn't want rice and they accommodated my request for plantains and black beans in its place. I tried my companion's pork dish, and it was delicious. This would be a fun place to go with lots of people and get pitchers of mojitos.	4.0
This has become one of my favorite restaurants. It is BYOB and they will make an amazing sangria or you can just drink the wine. The tapas are delicious I've had picadillo with tostones and it was divine. For dinner the skirt steak was perfection. I am Cuban so I have standards when it comes to Cuban food and this is delicious. Also big portion of food. It does get busy but I guess I've gotten lucky because I've never had to wait when I have gone. Even if there is a wait, it is worth the wait.	5.0
The place was packed as I was told to expect at 8 in the evening. Fortunately for us ( my date and I ) we got seated in about half an hour. The staff was barely friendly, but again I did not go there to socialize with them and there was no time for them  to seat or stand and giggle with customers. The atmosphere set the pace for and enjoyable night... Everyone seemed contented.  Anyway, we got seated, the waiter opened our BYOB ( wine), and we ordered appetizer; ( stuffed sweet "savory" plantain)...I'm gulping!  He brought our appetizer within 10 mins by which time we ordered our main... I got coconut rice, sweet potato and fried fish with a mango sauce..... My date ordered grilled beef rib which was so tender that it  was "sucked" right off the bone..Bravo! To the chef/ cook.  I'm already thinking of going again!!	4.0
Great place to have a really good time. The manager is really nice. Food is great & it's BYOB . The staff is really nice as well	5.0
Can I give this place a 3.8? The very first time I came to Cuban Pete's, I was definitely wowwed by the cool decor and vibrant atmosphere. I didn't mind the noise because I was too enthralled by the fun vibes of this place. Then I came again.. and again.. and again.. and every time I came back, the more the noise level became predominantly annoying. I don't know if it's just me getting older but it's really DIFFICULT to have a conversation in this restaurant. Also because the decor and atmosphere were no longer a surprise to me, my view of this place gradually turned from awesome to okay. It's ridiculously loud so definitely not a place for senior citizens. As for the food.. not the best tapas but awesome sangrias!!! It's still a place I would recommend to anyone who has never been.	4.0
Cuban Pete's nice place gets crowded wait can be two hours if you get there past 7:00 pm on a Saturday sat outside with 15 people was kind of cramped out side area can be bigger or set tables up differently over all great hospitality good food sangria was good mojitos as well and the bill was very reasonable for having a party of 15 ate the skirt steak excellent goat cheese fritters and pernil with tostones excellent	4.0
I had two appetizers, one was the mashed plaintains with ground beef inside, it was very savory and delicious, for less that $4 three big ones were served and I also had tostones, it was good but they also have beans, onions, tomatoes, cilantro in it so its good all together mixed up.   The sangria is delicious, just make sure you bring your own alcohol to mix it in, I had a bottle of moscato and my waiter poured the whole bottle in and it was so good. There is a whole page on the menu for sangria and another for mojitos, they looked good as well and had real fruit pieces in them. We didn't finish our sangria so our waiter poured it into our wine bottle and let us take it home.     I ordered the skirt steak with mango chimichurri sauce, I'm really picky with my steaks and like them medium rare. It was absolutely delcious and was very tender and not chewy at all. The sauce was sweet and savory, there weren't mango pices in them but it makes the sauce. The skirt steak piece was huge, it came with coconut rice and a sweet potatoe. The coconut rice is very good and goes great with the steak, even if i ordered a dish that came with plain rice I would ask for coconut rice.   My boyfriend had the pulled chicken that was in like a tomotoe sauce or broth, still it was delicous and moist, his came with plain rice and sweet plaintains. Their sweet plaintains are the best and are moist but also a little caramelized so it's perfect. They give you a lot of food so we had leftovers which was great.   This place is very loud and dim like everyone says, I also came on a Thursday night and it was very busy but we did not have to wait, so I can't imagine what the weekends must be like. If you don't know what to order just ask your waiter like I did, he wasn't wrong at all.	5.0
Good food...long wait. They rush you out too. Veryyyyy loud here.	3.0
Came here for the first time about a month ago and every thing was amazing. To start off it's a BYOB so that's always a plus they have these sangria mixes that you just add your alcohol too or they taste great by themselves. The food was delicious I had the beef stew with coconut rice it was delicious I didn't want to stop eating but got stuffed so I took the rest to go. Would deff go back.	4.0
Fun and enjoyable... a little too loud but I was warned. there was a long wait, but we had put our name down and shopped a little at Anthropologie. I would rather go on a slower night next time. Loved the short ribs.	3.0
Totally overrated. So many people, when they hear we live in Montclair, ask about this place.  So disappointing. The food and service are really lacking. There are so many better places in this town that I would highly encourage you to pass.	2.0
Hey there starving carnivores, Cuban Petes is the place. The menu is the same all day and you will leave with a to go box. The food is amazing. All fresh and delicious. I had the Ropa Vieja which is tender beef with rice and carmelized plantains. Also the chicken lolipops are a must for appetizer. The chorrizo in vino is a favorite of my now too. The only thing is the lack of alcohol in their drinks. You can bring your own since its BYOB. Service is average, the latin guys are real nice. Deliciuos and awesoem. Will be back again.	4.0
BYOB can't go wrong	5.0
So we live in New York but make a trip to Monclair just for this place...its that good!!! We have been here about four times and everytime it has been a delight. You go in starving and come out with biggest smiles on your faces. Its always been great experience here with very authentic Cuban food, not at all rich with oil or unnecessary jazz; it is simple and full of flavors. The prices are medium and the service is excellent. The pork entree is definitely the best, also the tapas Empanada de Queso and tapas Chuletas are amazing. The dishes are very well seasoned, its never too much salt or oil. The dishes are a bit big so one entree is good for two...well unless you like your big portions. Also the tapas are so good, try them out they are not too expensive and are big portions as well.	5.0
I was there last night with my wife and daughter for dinner. The place is really nice makes you feel like you are in a Miami style Cuban restaurant. The prices on the menu are really good because you get a lot of food. A lot of flavor on the good, their tapas menu is really good too. They also have a large variety of different Mojito flavors. I drove all the way from NYC and it was all worth it. I will recommend this place to everyone. You can also bring your own bottles of wine or beer to the place. The only thing I didn't like too much was that the mojitos don't have much alcohol but they are very refreshing and delicious.	5.0
Cool atmosphere, very loud, but good for a date or with big group.. We ordered the sangria, but it was only 0.5% alcohol, so I recommend bringing your own drinks, since it is a BYOB. The food was great, we ordered a bunch of tapas dishes and split them. We ordered the chicken lollipops, beef empenadas, rib tips and pulled pork with fried plantains. The ribs were a little bland, but everything else was delicious. Definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it.	4.0
Date night and decided to order a bunch of tapas and a side of rice. The perfect amount of food for us and all very flavorful! Definitely worth coming back!	5.0
The food is beyond amazing. I go here on the regular. But the last time I was there which was last Wednesday, the music was extremely loud, I couldn't hear a thing my boyfriend was saying. Our server also messed up my boyfriends order. His salmon was supposed to be served with coconut rice and came served with rice and beans. I could tell they don't really care about their customer service points.	3.0
There's only a few restaurants I can rely on to give me a satisfying meal time and time again. Cuban Pete's happens to make that very short list. I've eaten at this place easily 20-30 times and have yet to be served something I didn't like. My favorites would have to be the Empanada de Queso and Chuletas. The portion sizes will have you bagging the leftovers to go home with. This restaurant is also BYOB so be sure to stock up on some wine before you go. This is the one aspect that will probably have the most conflicting opinions from people. While Cuban Pete's has a very authentic feel when it comes to the decor and staff attire, it's very frequently crowded and loud. Some of the tables are a little too close to each other. The orchestra of singing and drums during each birthday also gets tiring after the first few times. The outdoor seating is a nice option during the warmer months. The overall experience you will have is largely dependent on where you're seated. One of the other things Cuban Pete's is well-known for is long wait times to be seated. Every time I've been there, the wait has been at least 30 minutes. Not accepting reservations also doesn't help the matter. However, once you're seated, the staff are usually good with getting your food to you fast and handling any special requests. Nothing out of the ordinary here when it comes to the price tag. The prices are worthy of what you get. Food: 5/5 Environment: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Cuban Pete's is defintely not for everyone, but if you enjoy great food at the potential downside of some comfort, you will love this place.	4.0
Food was ok, waiter was slow and inattentive, music was loud but the chicken shishkebob was excellent.  Go for appetizers and byob and you'll enjoy.	3.0
I loved this place!!  I went on friday night around 7 pm and we didnt have to wait at all.  I called ahead asking whats the best time and was told anything after 7 will be a wait.  So im glad i listened.  The ambiance was awesome, was a little bit loud which made it hard for conversation, but fun nonetheless.  I would def go back.  Food was ok not the best ive had, but def good and portion size for the entrees were huge!	4.0
Was there for my friends birthday, long ass wait, the food was so mediocre, had the chicken con mango, no flavor, the rice was horrible, the cook doesn't believe in salt I think. Never again.	1.0
I like this place. The food and the environment is great, as long as it's not busy. That being said, please don't go on a weekend. Service becomes subpar on weekends when it's extremely busy. Last time I went was yesterday, Wednesday, and our waiter was nice and attentive. I had no problems flagging him down because he came to our table like every 20 minutes or something. Either that or I was in a very deep discussion with my best friend and didn't notice the time flying by. There was no wait when we came in either which was around 6pm. Anyway, what I'm really rating this place for is the food, most of their tapas and entrees taste good. I love love love their chicharon de pollo which is the chicken lollipops in this onion and cilantro sauce. The mariscada (seafood mix in broth, kind of like paella but without the rice) and the churrasco (skirt steak) are also both of my favorites. I've had both the red and white sangrias and they are absolutely wonderful as well. I really recommend just bringing in wine which the server will pour into the punch (the regular pitcher is about $12 and the large pitcher is about $15). And if you really wanted dessert, get the tres leches, it's perfectly divine. Or you can get it to-go because the portions for the main course is huge. Overall, it's a pretty good place to dine in. Oh and it's also very very loud in here so you'd have to constantly raise your voice. During the warmer months I recommend going for the outside seating which is better than having very loud music in the background. I do however think the music is charming, but I wish they would turn it down a little. Anyway if you've never been to Cuban Pete's, it's definitely worth a visit (just not on a weekend!). It's also pretty fun when there are birthdays, everyone sings and the servers bring out mini congas. PS: Sorry no pictures. Every time I go here, it's always for dinner and the lighting is dim and I hate using flash. But if you check out other people's photos, you'll see the food looks quite yummy.	4.0
I just have to divide this review in two parts. Food: 5 stars, came out quickly, it was hot and delicious. My friends and I absolutely loved the food, and the portions were very generous. Service: 1 star: HORRIFIC. The server was clearly incapable of handling a large section and it should be the management's duty to see him struggling. He was curt and it took him a half hour to take our orders, though he was quite angry when we said we weren't ready 30 seconds after sitting down. He didn't check up on us, made my friend go without water for another half hour, and when taking our orders, actually left the table when he told my friend they were out of something and he had to chose something else. Our quick hour lunch turned into two hours. I would have thought that for taking so long (and we were clearly unhappy, but never rude), he would have offered something, but no. I'm really torn whether to come back or not, as I'm not sure that the food was good enough to outweigh the terrible service.	3.0
Fun! It's really loud but the food is pretty good. Food: I suggest sharing lots of tapas and then going for a big meal. Their pork dishes are pretty good. If you enjoy Caribbean oxtail, don't order their oxtail meal- you won't like it. Ambiance: It's not as loud on weeknights but weekends tend to be unbearable. It's difficult to hear the person sitting next to you which can make dinner feel weird. The best part is the congo drums that come out for birthday celebrations.	3.0
I have been to Cuban Pete's quite a few times. Go early there's always a wait, but most of the food dishes are definitely worth the wait. BYO wine or alcohol to add to their "sangria" and/or "mojito". My only problem with Cuban Pete's is their extremely LOUD music. Please Please Please, if anyone from Cuban Pete's is reading this review!!!, tone it down a few decibals! I couldn't even hear myself think let alone try to talk to my family and friends at the table.	4.0
When we walked in, it was a pretty quiet afternoon.  We saw lots of empty tables, but they sat us right next to the bathrooms and stuck a family of 6 with little kids right next to us. I ordered a "Classic mojito".  What they didn't tell us is that there is no alcohol in the mojitos (at all!), which I would have liked to know before buying...juice.  The food was alright, but I wouldn't return. "Meh..." really summed it up.	2.0
While the food is good, I would not describe it as the star. Amazing service and vibrant fun atmosphere. If you are looking for an upbeat fun dining experience, step right in. BYOB - they have amazing Cubans fruit juice combinations to make your own tasty libations!	4.0
I went on late December last year and what caught most my attention was that I completely forgot how cold and white outside. It really took me to another place definitely far from winter and New Jersey. It felt warm and tropical. The music was in tone with the decor, as well as, the lighting. I think all this, even, enhances  the taste of the food. One experience through your 5 senses. Just get Diego Luna as your date and, you'll have it all, your own "Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights" kind of night, without the dancing of course! (who would be able to dance so cool, right?)	5.0
Not thrilled at all. I almost slipped down the stairs because they were wet and no signage. We were quickly ushered in and got a table, but or server was impatient and within a few moments he came for our order, and he didn't have much in the way of finesse. The food was good, except for the Cuban coffee I ordered which treated like burnt Sanka. Truly awful. The mojitos were non-alcoholic, but they charge as if they ARE. I have no idea why people rave over this place.	2.0
I've been to Cuban Pete's a few times now, and honestly I do not get what all the fuss is about. The atmosphere is what I imagine Cuba at Disney World's Epcot might be like - lots of guys in bowling shirts and fedoras banging on bongos and invading your personal space. Since they are ridiculously popular, you might think they would have a system in place to accommodate parties waiting to be seated. No such luck, however. Enjoy standing in a tiny doorway or stairwell with the rest of the crowd waiting to be called by the generally unfriendly hostesses. Or perhaps not, as I was left standing in a corner for 25 minutes until I found out that my name had been skipped...twice. The food? It's good. Not great. I'm not a big meat eater, and it's possible they do that really well, I wouldn't know. I'll usually stick to seafood or vegetarian fare, of which there is very little. The seafood paella on my last visit was mushy, buttery, not very fresh. I almost sent it back but I didn't want to be "that girl". And by the way, folks, WINE is main ingredient in sangria. Some might say a very important ingredient. Dumping a bottle of wine that I brought with me into a pitcher of grape juice is not the same as serving "legendary sangria". There are a lot of better, more authentic ethnic restaurant choices in Montclair. I will be exploring those options and not returning to Cuban Pete's anytime soon.	2.0
Service MUAH!!! Food fabulous!!! Tappas on point. And if you love fish try the Fried Whole Red Snapper.  And introduce yourself to the owner...he's the guy with the big smile & mustache.am	5.0
This place is deafeningly loud. The parking situation sucks. You may have to wait a while for a table on Friday and Saturday nights, especially if you're with a large group (I think you can call ahead now, I know last time I called they said they didn't take reservations.) Sometimes you will feel as if your server dropped off the face of earth (and if you call him from more than 10 feet away, he may not hear you because of the jackhammer volume music and diners. BUT the food is here is excellent! I'm a Cuban and I know good Cuban food. These guys can cook. The sangria is great, but it's weak. The good thing is they're BYO and your server will gladly dump it in (I don't recall a corking fee, I could be wrong.) The Lechon is the best you can find in Jersey. The Ropa Vieja is awesome. The Yuca is good. The Congri is good. I'm pissed that they took off the BBQ Guava Ribs, though. That was the best item on the menu by far.	4.0
The food here is obviously good and very reasonably priced. Why else would there ALWAYS be an obnoxiously long wait to be seated? But is there anything else they can do to improve their seating system? How about somewhere people can wait without having to crowd the stairs? I guess there's no reason for them to have to change anything because we keep coming back! My fave things on the menu: bacon wrapped dates appetizer (datilles) and the skirt steak!!	3.0
I love this spot!!! This is my go-to spot when any of my friends from NY are in town. The Cuban theme is genius. All of the guys where hats and they're dressed like local Cubans. I've never been to Cuba but I'm sure this is what it must feel like. In the summer it's especially nice because you can sit outside and look up at the stars. The sangrias are all delicious, my fav meal is the Mango chicken, with coconut rice and mango yams. I love this place.	5.0
I will admit I'm a bit of a NY snob, not much can outshine the city. But this Cuban place is better than any other Cuban place I have been to in NYC. FYI there aren't many Cuban restaurants in the city and most of them are crap. We came in on a Sunday night at 8pm, thinking that we will have a nice romantic dinner together, obviously i didn't check Yelp because it's clear as day BYOB and very loud. When we came in, it seemed like it was a Friday night, it was loud, pumping with Latin music and a bustling restaurants with young 20 and 30 somethings laughing and conversing the night away. The entrance of the restaurant is started with a walkway, lined with palm trees and laid with light stone flooring. First you come upon the outdoor seating which would be quite beautiful in the summer with a waterfall to compliment the summer evening sky. There is lots of seating in two areas of the restaurant one in by the waterfall enclosed and the main area (where we seat). The main sitting area was definitely loud and not at all what I was expecting on a Sunday night. So if you're on a romantic date rethink the location, you won't be able to talk, unless you read lips really well or pull a Koothrappali and have a texting date (sorry for The Big Bang reference). We ordered a pitch of "sangria" which is just juice and we didn't bring wine or alcohol with us #fail. Not worth $12.95 if there's no alcohol. The food was sooooo good! I was being quite indecisive that day so I got two tapas with sides. I got the Pernil con Tostones, which is shredded pork with fried plantain topped on black beans and mixed with a garlic mojo. DELICIOUS!! I could just eat that with rice for weeks if I had to. The pork was moist and the garlic mojo gave a great flavor profile to the pork. I also got the Chicharon de Pollo, basically fried chicken wings but served with a cilantro mojo, liked it but I didn't love it like the Pernil. Both of the tapas come in small bowls but I ordered a side of rice and black beans and I didn't finish everything, I was stuffed, and had the leftovers for lunch . My boyfriend has the Bahama Coconut Fish and it was very good, I only had a small taste because he finished it before I could get another bite. He was thoroughly stuffed and that's difficult to accomplish for him. The main dishes come in large, deep casserole clay looking dishes. We were going to get dessert but I saw sweet plantains and that became our dessert, much cheaper option to the $5 dessert that were on the menu. They were a prefect finish to out meal. The server was on it and I'm surprised he was able to hear everything through the loud music. I guess he can read lips. A must try if in Montclair. I really think they should open up in NYC! ;)	4.0
Grab a blankie, sit by the fire, and listen up because it's story time, my friends! I have never experienced such unprofessional treatment in the service industry in my life. After reading other reviews on facebook and other sites, I see it may be an issue of racial discrimination, which is really sad (I see posts about the owner calling customers Gringos, etc... wow). It's time to boycott this place. Don't support a local business that is rude to its willing customers. Eventually, this place will die out because of this treatment. But let's make that happen sooner than later, eh locals? Here's what happened: My family wanted to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday. A few days ago, my dad went to Cuban Pete's to check it out and speak with the staff about the fact that he'd like to have a group dine there on Saturday (today). Because they do not accept reservations, we thought we'd arrive at 4 pm and be out of the way before their big Saturday night rush. Well, we got there, and they refused to seat us because our group was too large. We said we'd break the group up and sit at two different tables to avoid that 'problem.' The 'manager' came to our table and actually said (and no, I couldn't believe she said this): "The owner does not want you guys here." We were like huh? what? You don't want business? Her response: "You came in here VERY demanding." I said ohhh we're 'demanding' food be served at a restaurant? How awful of us. Let's leave, they obviously don't want our business. They called the cops. The cops seemed to be pretty familiar with this scenario and I now understand from other reviews that this is not an uncommon occurrence for this fine establishment lol. We left (and luckily dined at another restaurant that treated us quite well!!!). My aunt arrived a few minutes later, not knowing what had happened yet. She asked if our party was there, and was told "Sure, go ahead, you can look for them, good luck." My aunt searched the restaurant and could not find us. She asked again and was told "A party already left." My aunt said the girl had a smirk on her face the whole time. Such professional service! #Sarcasm Thanks again, Cuban Pete's, for being extremely rude and unprofessional, and throwing insults to my dad on his 60th.	1.0
Great environment and food . The owner was so nice and help . Byob place which is a plus . Anything on this menu it awesome . The mixed drink are crazy good . I would say stop by on a busy night it more entertaining and fun night.	5.0
Have been here four times and have had great food and service. I highly recommend this hot spot	5.0
Cuban Pete's is such a cute place. The atmosphere is fun. The only thing I would have to say is the restaurant plays music fairly loud and you have to talk louder to the people you're sitting with. I went on a Monday around 10pm and it wasn't too busy. I can only imagine how busy it gets during prime time. The sangria was very good. We brought our own red wine to mix. I ordered the coconut shrimp which came with delicious coconut rice and sweet potatoes. We also got some appetizers to share, like the platanos and Cuban sandwiches. I definitely finished all my food because it was so delicious. I can't wait to go here again!	5.0
If youre looking for inexpensive dinner spot, this is not the place. It is a bit pricey, but the cost is reasonable given how delicious the food. Definitely worth the price!	4.0
Solid food that always hits the spot. Been a few times now and service has always been spot on as well. The menu is huge - always a chance to try something new! The coconut rice and sweet potato sides are always excellent.	4.0
I love this place! I have just recently moved to NJ from NYC and I am a huge lover of Spanish cuisine, Cuban Pete's hits the spot for me whenever I'm craving Spanish food. I will agree with the other reviews that during their busy time it can be very loud and crowded. But I have gone with friends on a Wednesday around 6pm and it is quite and lovely. I would recommend this place to everybody. P.S. I recommend the Carne con Papas (Beef Stew).	5.0
Always a positive experience at Cuban Pete's! Service is top notch and services is spot on. Sometimes can be loud but the food and the atmosphere are great. YES BYOB, our first visit we were drinking sangria and we thought we were drunk, it has no alcohol. . .	5.0
Wonderful, great food. The servers are very nice. Sangria is nice. The atmosphere is great. Can't beat it.	5.0
Cuban Pete's does not disappoint.  Just don't expect a quiet dinner.  If you come here it's for the party atmosphere, and as you walk down the corridor you are transported to a new world with great food and drinks.  Go wild!  I lean more towards the fish dishes as there is only so much you can do with beef.  I can't wait to visit again and again.	5.0
The only things that really suck with this place is if you are going during what I like to call "high tide". When the restaurant is busy, which it usually is, you have to wait. Normally, that is not a problem. I'm good at waiting. But just not on an overcrowded staircase for over an hour. That is def. a fire hazard. The wait staff is trying to squeeze past you. Some people are going up stairs, others down stairs. And the staircase is narrow. And you have to wait on the staircase otherwise if you don't hear your table name called out you are screwed. With all the money that that restaurant makes per night you'd imagine that they can at least order a table seating queuing system that vibrates and lights up when your table is ready. Because honestly i'd prefer to wait outside...in the rain! And I have waited outside...in the rain... while my party took turns having to sacrificially wait on the staircase like a soldier staying up at night so that the rest of the platoon can sleep. But the food is really good ;)	5.0

Oh, Cuban Pete's.  I just don't know what to do with you. BYOB. Bring your wine, they will turn it into Sangria.  Just like Jesus. I think Cuban Pete's is an okay choice for Wednesdays. And Tuesdays. And Mondays. And Sundays and maybe even Thursdays. But the last two times I have been on weekend nights, I have waited over two hours.  Once with just a party of 2, the other time pushing 2 and a half hours for a party of 3. The food is really not authentic Cuban.  It is totally decent, generic Latin food that tastes good if not a little bland depending on the dish.  But I'm not wowed.  With so many amazing restaurants nearby on Bloomfield Ave, I don't really understand how this place is STILL the go to place. Yes, its cute and fun. Yes, the sangria is good. The paella was the best thing I've tried here but it was not distinctly Cuban by any stretch. Maybe if your food was GREAT instead of decent to good. Maybe if you just effing took reservations. Maybe if the wait wasn't over 2 hours in a space the size of my entryway. Maybe if the service wasn't excellent vs incredibly harried to turn over tables as quickly as possible to accommodate the lingering lines. Maybe then I would love you. Until then, I will continue searching for a real Cuban restaurant 'round here.	3.0
Cannot wait to go back to Cuban Petes. The authentic, sangria cave-like bar of decadence is ace, because of the amazing punch like the "pink flamingo" for example, and being a vegetarian yuppie foodie and fine diner, I ordered the Paella and was so incredibly pleased beyond words and so satisfied! I had the coconut rice on-dish experience. My mouth was doing the Charanga! I cannot wait to go back.	5.0
I decided to give this place a second chance after being disappointed for the first time. I went for a friends birthday and I was disappointed once again! I ordered arroz con pollo and the chicken was very dry and the rice was dry as well. How do you ruin arroz con pollo?! Also the meal has so many bones in it I was afraid I was going to choke. The platanos were soggy, overall the meal was horrible and I couldn't even finish my meal. My friend didn't enjoy her meal either and she ordered the chuletas, she said they were dry as well. I was also annoyed that my friends bought wine because it's byob but they charged us bc we had sangria and the pitcher cost 13 bucks! The service wasn't that great it's very crowded with no space and it looks an accident waiting to happen with all the waiters running around and bumping into people. I will never come here again.	1.0
Great food, great sangria good times always. Go at an of hour, the place is small and tables are very close together. The music gets VERY loud you can't hear the person sitting next to you. BYOB	4.0
Being Cuban, I will be the first to say... been to spots in Union City..yeah they are ok, but this place for a little bit more $ is the real deal.  The food here is delicious, very well prepared.  The dishes are huge, the appetizers are excellent, the decor is original. You can here old Buena Vista Social Club playing in the background.  Gets packed on the weekends, but is well worth the wait.   I had this prior to leaving back for San Francisco, my new home, and boy was I happy.  Can't get this great Cuban cooking in the Bay Area unfortunately. BYOB, they make an array of cocktails that you can add your own booze to, and I hear they are good as well. Your waiter will be wearing a fedora and guayavera, which is pretty spot on as far as Cuban attire goes.  Friendly service, and they are very familiar with the menu. Great place IMO.	5.0
As usual I had expected a great time here...our waiter was attentive and friendly, and the food was overall very good. We got the naked seafood paella, which had a delicious tomato broth, as well as the mango chicken. Both made decent, comfortably filling portions for sharing too--something to consider if you want to taste a little bit of everything at the table. The atmosphere is fun and it is great to sit outside when it's a nice night in Montclair. I highly recommend BYOB for either the sangria or the mojitos to top off a fun night. One thing to note is that it gets pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights. It's definitely easier to get a table for a smaller 2-4 person group vs a bigger one. The restaurant is also poorly laid out--you're expected to wait on the tight stairwell with everyone because the host stand is inconveniently placed at the bottom of it and there's no other place to comfortably wait. Minus a star for me. A major issue with my recent visit to Cuban Pete's was that my date and I were placed at a 4-person table (which was basically two wobbly tables put together) close to the entrance from Bloomfield Ave. While it was fine at first, it became a problem at the end of the night when one of the hostesses walked right into the table we had our alcohol on as she rushed about because it was so busy. As a result, the alcohol spilt all into my purse when it knocked over. She failed to realize the extent of what had happened so she simply gave us a handful of napkins and walked away, which indicated to me that she was insincere about her apology. This behavior of the hostess unusually contrasts with the great waiters I've had in the past and I am sorely disappointed that I now have to spend an additional two times the amount that I did on the meal to have my bag cleaned. I'll have to closely consider where I sit if I come back to Cuban Pete's and hope that the hostesses will have worked on their attitudes a bit next time around because I do genuinely enjoy coming back to this restaurant every now and again.	3.0

Yes it's loud here, but it's busy and noisy for a reason. The food is fantastic, service is great. I've been here a couple of times and I'm never disappointed. Bring your own bottle of wine and get some sangria. The Habana Banana is amazing. Last time I came I had the strip steak; it was so juicy and tender and the plantains were a perfect side. This time we went for tapas, and it was awesome. The Datiles, bacon wrapped dates, are TO DIE FOR. I could eat a whole plateful! If I could make it to dessert, I'd get flan, but I always eat too much. So good!	5.0
I actually used to enjoy this place and have been here over a dozen times but since these d-bags decided to delete my review I'm going to add another one with the real LD.  The owner is a womanizing scumbag that will try and steal your girl if you get up to go drop a deuce, luckily he looks like a cracked out version the "The Fonz" so unless you're mad ugly or have absolutely no game, you shouldn't have any problem competing with him.  The "outside" area is basically where they should have the stripper pole, it's like being at a frat party, people doing keg stands, slamming down shots, breaking bottles over dudes heads, screaming, shouting, the whole 9.  The food is sub par but basically you're paying to go there and get hammered and hopefully bang one of the many drunk chicks that can be seen puking in the fountain at any given time.	1.0
Food: Being a vegetarian, the food is okay. There is only one item on the menu that you can get. My friends who are meat eaters, absolutely love the place though. They claim that this is one of the better cuban food that they've had. The best things about this place is that their sangrias. Make sure you bring your own wine though!   Ambiance: The place is packed all the time and so make sure you get there early. Its always frustrating when places don't take reservations but force you to waited in their cramped stairwell while you wait for your table. The space is extremely loud and full of energy. It's a great place to hang out with friends cause you can be as loud as you need to be.   Costs: The food was reasonably priced. Since this is BYOB it comes out about $25/person.  Would I go back? Probably	3.0
I've never been to a restaurant where everything was amazing. Not good, not great, but AMAZING. We has Skirt Steak, Oxtail, Chicken, Cuban Sandwich, All Perfect. The kids really lives the Chicken Fingers and the Potato Balls. The Peach-Lemonade Sangria made everything taste better. The only problem with the place is that it's always crowded. Very hard to move around. The Cuban music they play is enjoyable at first, but you will get a headache from how loud it is. All-in-All: This Restaurant Is Amazing.	5.0
The food there is to die for and the price is to love . Love the ambiance this place is my fav place to go out to dinner with friends and family.	5.0
This was my third time at this place. Like another reviewer said, this place is a hit or miss.  The first and second time (the hits) food was good. Perhaps the hit was to due to being a little tipsy resulting in a lower standard. I have always order the Churrasco, medium well and mango mojitos. The third and last visit, I wasn't as tipsy as I was hosting a get together. The food was bland and the presentation was very sloppy. This was my husband's first time going. He was not happy with food nor the loud music. He argued we could get better Cuban food on Bergenline Ave in Union City, NJ for cheaper prices.  I had told him this place was very good, so was very disappointed when was just okay. Furthermore the place was even LOUDER, if that is possible,  than my previous visits. I don't think we will go again.	2.0
Food is very good ambiance is fun and after adding your favorite libration to a base of house mojito the very loud sounds become so much more tolerable.	4.0

This is the best place to go to if you want to experience the exotic Cuban culture and cusine. I had wine , paella and my husband had chicken with rice and plantains.Both entree were served in a clay pot with a plantain leaf which was very earthy and warming.The food was served hot and fresh and the flavors & presentation were amazing .The decor interiors  and staff were dressed to match the Cuban theme which made me feel like I was not in Montclair but in CUBA.This place is always packed with guests so be ready to wait to be seated.	5.0
I cannot beleive what I saw this evening.  My wife and I went with another couple.  The other couple's wife put her name on the list.  The lady at the desk said: "it will be a few minutes."  She then pointed for us to stand in another room, where she clearly could not see us.  We waited at the entrance to the other room, so we could see the front desk. 20 minutes later, I went to the desk and asked the lady how much longer, she said: "you guys are the next table of 4."  I said "so how long is that?"  She said: "just a few minutes."  I went back to my friend and told him she said it will be "just a few more minutes." 15 minutes later, the other couple's wife went to the desk and asked how much longer, and she was told: "you are the next table of 4."   During this entire time period (35 minutes), we clearly saw the maitre d' seat people that were just coming in (groups of 2 and 3, and one group of 9), and putting their names on the list.  He knew these people and were taking them off the list and seating them, despite there clearly being other people ahead of those people on the list.   15 minutes later the matre d' asked my friend "how long have you been here."  My friend said "almost 1 hour" he looked at his watch and said "about 50 mintues."  The matre d' then said "how long were you told?"  My friend said: "the lady told my wife a few mintues.  Then, about 20 minutes later, she told my friend [pointing at me] a few minutes."  He then said "which lady said that" and my friend pointed her out.  A few seconds later, the matre d' returned to us with the lady.  He said to my friend: "Did she say a few minutes to you."  My friend said: "No, she said a few minutes to my wife and my friend."  He then asked her if that is what she said and she sad "no, I told them 1 hour."  He said: "she never told you a few minutes."  My friend then said: "So that means you are calling my wife and my friend a liar."  The matre d' said: "Leave the restaurant, we are not seating you."  My friend said: "You are not seating us after waiting for almost an hour now, because she is accusing my wife and friend of lying."  The matre d' said: "she never said a few minutes, we are not seating you, leave the restaurant."  He then started waving his arm in the air screaming "next group of 4, who is 4."  He still wasn't looking at the list. We then left.  Let me make real clear, if she had told us an hour, we would have gone to one of the other hundreds of restaurants in Montclair; we never would have waited an hour for a table at Cuban Pete's.  I have been there before, and it is not worth an hour wait. If the management does not fire the matre d', there is really something wrong with this place.  If the matre d' is management, then an investigation needs to be conducted into the operations of the restaurant and whether there is any discrimination taking place.  And, this restaurant needs to be avoided.	1.0
Love love love this place!! My friend and I visit here often and are always satisfied. I used to live in Jersey but moved to nyc but I still travel to Cuban Petes. The food has tons of great flavor and always comes out nice and hot. My favorite entree is Carlitos Way chicken. The coconut rice and yams that come with it are amazing. The staff here is always very friendly and the owner is awesome. It does get crowded especially on the weekends so expect a little wait. Weekdays are a little less crowded. They should expand another restaurant to the bronx or harlem perhaps. They would get sooo much business. To me their cuban food tastes way better and authentic than any other place in the nyc.	5.0
To be honest, this place is hit or miss. I had one pretty great meal here and one so-so meal. I was pretty drunk for the great meal so it's very possible I had drunk hunger goggles and low standards. Some of the menu items are pretty good, others are eh, a bit bland. It's BYOB so that's always cool. Some drawbacks are: *popularity: there's a wait during peak time and if you are waiting inside, you are uncomfortably huddled in a small waiting area *lack of privacy: the tables are pretty close together *noise: It gets pretty loud. The first time I went with my parents, we could barely hear each other across the table. Not ideal. They also had dudes playing bongo drums which was kinda cool but very loud/obnoxious as well. *parking situation could be a hassle, especially during peak time Otherwise, it's a cool place, has a ton of personality, and if you navigate the menu correctly, you could have a good meal on your hands. just avoid busy times if you want a more calm experience	3.0
I'm a HUGE fan. This was my first experience with Cuban food outside of a Cuban Sandwich. I was hesitant at first to know that the restaurant was in Montclair. Don't ask me why. It's a 20/25 minute drive from my house. I don't get out there often when eating out. I also seem to chronically forget that there is very accessible parking. Here's my experience: We headed down to Montclair at about 9:30PM. When we got into downtown Montclair, things were relatively calm along the street but there was a decent crowd in front of Cuban Pete's. We circled around the back of the restaurant and found many free parking spaces and even CP's own parking lot right by it's entrance. The restaurant stands out from the outside. It has a classic logo and some colorful paint to make it pop. We enter in the back door and walk down a tall flight of steps. The restaurant is bustling inside and its 10PM! The waitress puts us outside which is an open air courtyard within the center of the restaurant. The tables were a little cramped but we made due because there were not many people on or near us. There was a nice crowd of people within the courtyard, Cuban music serenading us (and tempting us to dance), and a beautiful night sky. As you sit down and take a look around, you immediately notice the several large jars of sangria in the back room. Many different flavors, all on the menu. We should have AND YOU SHOULD bring your own wine/brandy, whatever you should choose to kick up your sangria. It was delicious and affordable regardless. From there, we teeeeddd off on the menu. Here's what we ordered: Sangria Ceviche (Queen Tigerfish Marinated in a Citrus Pomegranate), Goat Cheese Fritters (Hazelnut Stuffed Goat Chese with a Sweet Honey Vinagrette), Platanos Relleno (Sweet Plaintain and Queeo Blano Fritters), Costillas De Manolo (From our Gallego/Cubano Chef- Long bone short ribs in a traditional rojo sauce, served with Arroz con Gandules and Yuca Con Mojo) and Pollo De Guayaba (Half Baked Chicken in Guava, Served with Arroz Con Gandales and Yuca Con Mojo). Verdicts: Sangria Ceviche: Delicious, Original, but More Food than we Expected. Goat Cheese Fritters & Platanos Relleno: Both Delicious, Savory, and Amazing. Costillas De Manolo: HUGE! Meat Fell Apart with Knife. Sauce with Great Kick. Pollo De Guayaba: Dry Chicken, Sauce Left a Little to Be Desired. Arroz Con Gandules & Yuca Con Mojo: Both Delicious, Serviceable Sides. There are VERY LARGE PORTIONS. So heads up upon ordering. I will say that the food did make for phenomenal lunch the day after. Also, you really should know, the price of this place is almost criminally cheap. They deserve much more money for what they serve up. However, I'm not complaining. Will indulge again for sure. The waiters, notably all dressed very well with fedoras, were very accommodating, pleasant, and not overbearing. Despite is walking in within an hour of their closing, they were not pushy and were very considerate. THIS IS A MUST EXPERIENCE RESTAURANT! CHECK IT OUT!	5.0
Came here or my birthday which was awesome! They play the drums and put a hat on you while they sing their own version of happy birthday! The food is so good! Especially the pernil! The service was just as good! Very friendly staff! I'm already planning on coming again just not when it's so crowded!	5.0
Step off the streets of Montclair and you are transported to Cuba. Cuban Pete's is fun, LOUD, great for big groups and laughs with a friend. The food is fantastic. Ropa Vieja is my personal favorite. It is the perfect place to go on a summer night. Sit outside in the patio, have a class of sangria, have some tapas and fall in love.	5.0
Great place for cuban food and sangria if you're in the Montclair area! The wait can be long so go there early and put your name on the list. Recommend: Chicharon de pollo Vaca fritas Asia de Cuba (sangria) - The alcohol is only 0.5%, but you can bring your own wine to spice it up some more)	4.0
After hearing good things from other people I decided to give Cuban Pete's a try.  In my opinion it was a waste of time. We waited over an hour to get a table and when we were finally seated the room was so loud I could barely hear myself think. In addition to the undesirable atmosphere, the food was mediocre at best.	1.0
Even if you go to Cuban Pete's on a weeknight your still gonna wait at least a half hour and that's only if you don't keep bothering the hostess to seat you.  The poor girl looked like she was gonna lose her mind.  The food is ok. There's are a ton of Cuban restaurants with better food and less of a crowded rush. Don't order the braised rib.  It was soooo fatty.  We brought our own wine and they brought us sangria without the wine in it. What?  Ok I'm done.	2.0
My co-worker raved about this place so we went one evening. I didn't realize it was BYOB but she came prepared with wine. I have to start with the atmosphere...gorgeous. The building surrounds a beautiful patio which is sort of tightly packed, but still intimate. Two big thumbs up for atmosphere. They have sangria options which sound amazing, though we drank our wine straight so I didn't get to try any. The food was...decent. Nothing to write home about. We had the tapas, so it was great to have a bunch of options. I'd say even though I probably won't be back, I'd still recommend it. It's certainly worth a try.	3.0
Although I enjoyed the food and atmosphere of Cuban Pete's be WARNED if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, especially in the summer. I contacted the restaurant earlier in the week to see if I could make a weekend reservation, but it seems they do not take reservations for busy times. When we arrived we made our way through the extremely hectic outside area to a small hallway that connected the indoor restaurant from the outside. This hallway area was filled with people waiting to be seated and posed a semi-dangerous situation. The small area was filled with people AND had the wait staff scurrying back and forth with plates of food, sangria pitchers, and stacks of glasses. Several times there were near collisions between waiters and patrons. I was anticipating black beans to fly in the air at some point because a crash of bodies seemed imminent. The wait area situation is really my only gripe with the restaurant. The service was quick and friendly once we were seated and the food was tasty and quite reasonable. I appreciated the BYOB that is used to create sangria. I recommend getting a few tapas if you are with a group. The chorizo in red wine was probably the best appetizer we ordered, but the ham croquetas, spinach empanadas (small), and meat dumpling (two large dumplings) were also good. My ropa vieja was the most flavorful version I've had at a restaurant. I also loved the sweet plantains! Cuban Pete's is a very reasonably priced restaurant with very good food, but I would not return during the busy nights/time blocks again unless the restaurant changed their wait policy/area. I'll be going on off nights from now on.	4.0
It's like walking into Havana, except smaller and probably cleaner, and a little further north.  Ok, it's probably nothing like Havana, but the food is good and they deal with kids well.  So, there's that.	4.0
This is a fun place with good food and a noisy atmosphere. It was the perfect spot to meet with some old friends and catch up. I had the ribs (forget exactly what they called it.) Very tasty. All 5 of us liked our food. It's a BYOB, but they will mix you drinks or sangria. The only 2 drawbacks: They leave all doors and windows open in nice weather, so you are swatting flies between bites. Also, for birthdays, they have a group of waiters come out and bang drums and various other percussion instruments. Since we had a birthday at our table, we went home half deaf. I don't mind, but some people might.	4.0
Good place to go during summer time. Place is big enough that they have an outdoors sitting area as well. Food was decent kinda reminded my of cafeteria food wasn't great but wasn't that bad the rice was stale, and my chicken was ok though. My wife ordered oysters and try only have her 4 most places they give at least 8 for that price . It was also pretty loud in there as well	3.0
I just love this place!!!	5.0
Great food. Great service. Greg was a fantastic. Ordered the jumbo shrimp and sooo good. Definitely coming back anytime I'm in Montclair. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know the wait is long, but the food and service make up for it. And you have to love the BYOB... So much food for a mediocre bill. It's worth checking out.	5.0
Felt like we took a mini vacation to Cuba...   The food tasted good to me - not that I'm an expert on Cuban food...    I like the whole BYOB wine and make sangria thing..  very cool place.    tables are super close together. Wife and I liked our waiter and the rest of the staff seemed nice.  Reading a lot of racial comments, but I felt very welcomed...  We are planning to go back - it was fun. good spot	4.0
Let me start by saying the food was awesome! The decor was great. My party had zero complaints regarding any of that. Our issues are with the sneaky billing practice our waiter pulled. We were a party of six, and when the check came we thought it was unusually high, but did not look too far into it. Per the receipt, the tip was not included. The bill that was handed to us was 249.56. We gave the waiter 300. So rather then doing the honest thing and informing us that the tip was included, he decided to help himself to 45% tip. I have no issue with a tip being included for a party of six or more, the problem is not putting it on the receipt. If you do a search at this place, it's not the first time they've done fishing things regarding the check. Like I said, awesome food, but not worth getting robbed.	2.0
Nice atmosphere feels a bit like miami. A but noisy at our table with kids but a nice atmosphere. Enjoyed the tapas small dishes. Service a little slow on Friday but servers where all very nice. Building was cool looking. Waiters decked out in Cuban hats and shirts nice!	4.0
Love this place! Best Cuban spot in Jersey and even in the NYC metro area. Large portions, plantains, coconut milk rice, great presentation. Sangria that is so delicious plus they sometimes bring out the drums to entertain the guests as they eat. Only down side is parking so I usually do lunch there, I can only imagine how difficult it is to find a spot in the evening, its even difficulty during daytime hours and you have to pay for meter parking if u aren't lucky to find a spot on the street. Enjoy...u won't be disappointed. Plus you can enjoy walking off that great food down the streets of Bloomfield Ave!	5.0
Best Cuban Food I ever had...so yummy! I also love the atmosphere it's very sexy & chic! The owner Dominick is a BIG SWEETHEART he always comes around to make sure we are enjoying ourselves!! Your crazy not to try this place!!!	5.0
Ambience is rather noisy, but the food was good. If you can tolerate yelling at the person your eating with then this is the place for you. I just found it to be too nosey, maybe going there earlier will be best.	3.0
Great Cuban food and great atmosphere. There are some other factors though that take away from it being a truly 5 star experience. Some of these factors are beyond their control but still, it is a part of the experience of going there. The appetizer portions are truly small.. like feeding your cat small, which hits home because they are so fricking tasty! The restaurant is almost always very loud which can be a negative depending on your reason for being there. The parking also sucks.	3.0
I wish I tried this place sooner! I can not say enough great things about it.  The minute you walk in you feel like your on a vacation ( and not off the streets of montclair).  It is the perfect spot for any summer night. The food was delicious.  It was a bit loud at times but what do you expect from waiters walking around with instruments? Im ready for more!	5.0
Great food - had the oxtails and the ropa vieja, both were great. Good rice and beans and the plantains were amazing. The dining room was a little crowded with tables and chairs, so they lose 1 star. I came at a slow time - I think it would be too crazy for my on a Fri or Sat night.	4.0
Never disappoints!!  The fried red snapper, cerviche, steak- everything is good here!  Service is great and its BYOB !	5.0
Food is very good, service can be a bit slow at times.  VERY loud.  Don't go on a weekend night unless you want to wait a loooong time.	4.0
The food was great and the atmosphere fun.  My husband loves the pulled pork sandwich.  I love their sangria. Great place for a quick, easy dinner out.	4.0
I would definitely recommend this spot for anyone searching for outstanding Cuban food! I ate here twice within two weeks (rare for me) and I could definitely see it being a weekly stop if I lived in the area. The food is intoxicatingly good. Both times I ordered fish dishes, rice and peas, and plantains. They have an appetizer of chicken lollipops that are definitely more delicious than they sound! The ambiance is a direct throwback to old Cuba. Gorgeous. The courtyard is especially beautiful at night. The second trip I took my 6yr old and was very pleased when a hostess engaged him in a bit of conversation. Always a plus when establishments treat kids as people too. The only reason I am leaving 4 out of 5 stars is because the noise level is too loud to carry on conversation. Not great for getting to know someone on a date or a relaxing evening. But I am definitely a fan and will continue to go!	4.0
Good food but nothing to go on away. When my friend ran Hard Grove Cafe in Jersey City - now that was a cuban restaurant to rave about. Typical cuban food but the prices are way too high. What else to expect from restaurants in suburbs near NYC.	3.0
Decent food, great drinks, lovely patio. It's really not all that Cuban. Lol it is more of a uniLatino restaurant- meaning they have dishes from many Latino countries. It is a fun but noisy place and always crammed. If you want really authentic Cuban food, and an expansive menu go elsewhere.	3.0
If you go when its not busy this place is pretty good. Otherwise its just a little too much. Too noisy. Too many tables packed into every corner. Mediocre service at best. That said the food is pretty good, not blow your mind good but still pretty good. Go for lunch on a off day and have the ropa vieja is my reccomend.	3.0
I have for the longest time wanted to go to this place and when I went there, I didn't know what the hype was all about. I pride myself in know what great Ropa Vieja is and when I ordered it, it was just about OK. the great part about this place is that its BYOB and they will make sangria for you if you bring wine. The place is very very noisy and loud. That being said the service was very good and I wish there was a way to give 3.5 stars and not just 3.	3.0
The food and the sangria's at Cuban Pete's are well worth it. My friends and I ventured here in the spring while visiting another friend who knew just where to take us. My goodness was it spectacular. We split a bunch of items off the menu and found ourselves completely stuffed after wards, we were also pretty sauced with the sangria since we brought our own bottles of wine for the mix. We had a bottle of red and a bottle of white and all I could say is we had the best of both kinds. My friend took us after the lunch rush would be over so it wasn't as crowded as it normally would be. The service was wonderful, quick, and very helpful. I wish I could remember what we had to eat because I assure you it was fantastic. I highly recommend going to Cuban Pete's and trying multiple dishes with friends so you can get a good idea of what you want the next time you come back. I'm def. getting my friend to bring me back here when I come to visit NJ again.	5.0
Great food	5.0
Absolutely love this place!  I hosted my mother's 70th birthday in a private room of theirs for 35 people and everyone had an amazing time and absolutely loved the food.  Their menu selections are great, the pricing is great and you cannot go wrong for the amount of food and beverage you get on their party package menu. Time and time again this place and the food never disappoints.   Do yourself a favor though and plan ahead for a weekend meal there as you can wait for over an hour or two for a table from Friday - Sunday and they do not take reservations.  It's that good!	5.0
Went there on a Friday afternoon with a party of 12.  When I called, the hostess said they did not take reservation even when I mentioned it was for 12.  We showed up at 1:30 which was perfect timing.  By 2pm, the place was packed! I ordered the Churassco which I was disappointed with but the blame was entirely mine.  I ordered it medium rare and the steak was very chewy.  I didn't want to send it back to have them re-cook it.  The rest of our table enjoyed their meal. Service was very good.   I mentioned to the waiter it was one of the guys's birthday and gave him a cake to be served at the end of our meal.    They came out with the cake playing the bongo! The place is very loud as some had mentioned.  It's a BYOB but the liquor store was next door.  Also the parking lot is metered so bring quarters!	3.0
I had never had Cuban food before and honestly didn't know what I was expecting here. Well, I'm hooked.	5.0
The food is generally good but there's some excellent items on the menu. The Cuban sandwich is great as is the ox tail. Paella was chock full of seafood. It's crowded but if the line is too long, just go somewhere else. You're in Montclair after all.	4.0
Great food. Decent price. The waiters are not very attentive and the outdoor seating is not where you want to be when it's hot out. Great vibe though. You forget your in Mountclair.	4.0
Excellent food and the environment really gives you a flavor of the Latin culture. The owner is always there working, making sure everyone is well taken care of. Dom is the man. I see some complaints about a wait. Very simple to say that the wait is because of the demand. I much prefer to wait than walk into an empty restaurant. This is an awesome place! We always feel like our business is appreciated and have had the opportunity to catch a cigar in the from after dinner and chat with the owner. Reservations- give me a break! Go to a Cuban restaurant in the city that takes reservations and compare the food and price. Remember you are not paying 35-40 dollars per plate. What's next expecting Panera to take reservations?	5.0
there nothing better than cuban pete"s .. as soon as you walk in the door takes away to cuba or some place away from home ...smell of the food in the kitchen there nothing better ... and for all people the complain about the wait if the place was not good do you really think there would be a 2 hr wait ... think about it .. cant wait to go back ... a+++	5.0
The food at Cuban Pete's is great, but SO many other aspects of this restaurant are just off. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. They don't take reservations for small groups and there is always a wait, plus the hostesses are not friendly and never seem to know what they're doing. I've been dining here for years, though, because it's a fun place to go with a group of friends, the food and sangria are always on point, and the servers are speedy and charming. I came here most recently on a Thursday night at 8:30 with a group of 4. It was a rainy night so they weren't seating customers outside, and therefore the inside was packed. We were told we'd be seated at 9:45, but luckily we ended up getting a table at 9/9:15. Our large pitcher of "Armando's Passion" sangria came quickly, to which we added our own white wine. Like always, it hit the spot. We then ordered our usual entrees: lechon asado (roasted pork) for me, ropa vieja (shredded beef) and bahama coconut fish for my friends. Despite the crowdedness of the restaurant, our food came out in minutes and was delicious just as expected. The lechon is very garlicky, which I personally love but could definitely be a turn-off for some. My friends enjoyed their meals, too. My biggest complaint about Cuban Pete's? It may be the loudest restaurant in the entire world. Not a joke. The music played in each room is at top volume, forcing diners to yell at each other. On top of this, the servers celebrate someone's birthday nearly every 5 minutes by banging on drums and chanting, which gets verrrry annoying. There are many things to complain about here, yet I still love it and keep coming back.  Try it out and see for yourself.	4.0
The only reason I can't rate Cuban Pete's any higher is simply due to long waits in a crowded, very narrow hallway on every visit.  Beyond that - - the food is always great and the Sangria makes the wait worth it!	3.0
My favorite restaurant, now. Had a little bit of everything. Sweet plaintains, steak , paella Byob makes it even better. Great location and even better music. Come here and try a little bit of everything. the Churrasco is mi favorito plato. Ven conmigo!	5.0
The food at Cuban Pete's is fantastic and the waiters are absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, the way the front of house treats people is just abysmal.   I was throwing a little surprise party for a friend and had 14 people total.  I knew it's always a long wait, so I sent one of the other host of the party there 1.5 hours early to put our names on the list for a table so that we could probably have a table by the time the guest of honor arrived.  Even if we had to wait longer, no big deal. Despite him getting there very early, the hostesses refused to put our table on the list until all 14 of us were there.  She didn't tell us until AFTER we had people waiting and the other co-host waited for 1.5 hours.  She then informed us that now we could go on the list and it would be 2 hours. Oh, they also refuse to take reservations on the weekends. I get that they are always busy and that they really don't need our money because of that fact, but really, terrible way to treat customers.   I would have been fine if someone had said at the beginning that they won't be able to even put us on the list until we all arrived and THEN the wait would start.  That would have been nice.  I would have said okay, I understand that business is business and if you can't accomodate such a request, then that's okay.  But it's like they went out of their way to be nasty. Instead, they treated us like we were bothering them by showing up.	2.0
This place is horrific - just awful.  I am shocked at how busy they are and the reviews they get.  They are all about turnover and I think they stopped trying.  If my review prevents at least one person from living this nightmare I will sleep better at night. I have been here 3 times.  The first time (long before I was yelping) I did not like it at all.  My friends seem to like it so I had returned a second time for a birthday celebration.  The bday girl wanted to go here, so I had no say (I did state my distaste).  So, two years goes by and we return for another bday celebration.  I vow to not complain, but luckily everyone else in my party picked up the slack by the end of the visit.  We will not be returning - this was the last straw. They don't take reservations on weekends, but we showed up early (Sat 5:30 PM) and were seated somewhat quickly outside.  There were people waiting at this time.  It was a nice day so we were all ok with it.   The tables are so close together (more on that later) and the music is blaring.  It is like this both inside and outside - overcrowded - people waiting to be seated while cowering over your table, you need to dodge staff carrying food, garbage cans, dirty silverware.  Ladies - leave your stillettos at home - avoiding these obstacles while walking on the uneven floor is a recipe for disaster.   The bathroom is filthy.  There are only 2 stalls and no lock on one of the doors.  They were also out of paper towels. I can let the paper towel thing slide, but it supports the fact that the staff does not care.  A decent restaurant would have staff checking the bathroom hourly - something they do not do here. We sit down and our server comes over rather quickly and wants to take our order NOW.  We order water and sangria.  Not good enough - he wants our food order.  We kindly tell him we are still looking and need our drinks first.  Walks away in a huff.  Water arrives (they bring a pitcher, glasses are on the table) - I pour all of my friends glasses and then get to mine.  As I am pouring I notice the glass is filthy. I discretely set my glass over to the side and ask of a new one, as it was dirty.  Out comes the sangria and a stack of glasses - all pretty gross looking.  Not that the staff does not pour water or sangria for you - you're on your own here. Like I said earlier - I promised not to complain so just accepted the fact that I would be drinking out of a dirty glass.  I was pretty grossed our after I poured my wine/sangria mixture and there was a film of oil sitting on the top of my beverage.  Telltale sign the glasses are dirty.  My friend sent back her empty appetizer plate and silverware because it was dirty - and one of the knives looked like a shark had bitten into the side of it.  No apolagies from the staff.  They were actually angry with us. We then ordered apps and our mains.  Apps came out - but incorrectly.  Half the dishes were correct, the other half was not.  We told the gentleman (not our server) delivering the food that some of the dishers were not ours and we were missing things.  He did not know what dishes were what but insisted that we ordered those dishes - we told him no and he took back what was not ours.  Two minutes later another, much ruder man came to the table with the dishes we just sent back.  He was insisting they were ours and that we ordered them.  He was very rude and the behavior was unacceptable.  Or server finally came over and brought us the dishes we were missing.  No apolagies from staff here either. Appetizers included - Goat cheese fritters - goat cheese is always tasty - but greasy greasy greasy Chicken lollipops - pretty good Shrimp - tasted fishy Chorizo - I usually love chorizo but this was served literally in a bowl of grease. Chicken empanadas - not very tasty Spinach empanadas - good, but we ordered beef, not veggie Dates wrapped in bacon - they were out of those We finished our apps and the mains were brought out with our appetizer plates still on the table.  So we stacked our own plates because their hands were full.  Also unacceptable. I had the vaca frita - beef was good but super greasy as were the plantains - SWIMMING in grease.  My friends all had skirt steak and no one enjoyed it - not cooked correctly, sauces were not good.  They claimed that the quality of food had gone way down since the last time they were there. We were going to order dessert but they were out of what we wanted so we decided enough was enough  - lets get out. This experience was similar to eating in a zoo.  Other guests, while waiting for a table (they never put there name on a list - just stood next to a table where people were leaving and sat down before the table was cleared - and staff didnt even try to send them to the host stand.  We noticed this because they were hovering over our table while we were eating.  Once they sat down one of the children actually had his elbows on our table watching us eat.   Out of characters	1.0
Made the mistake of coming here on a Friday night when they don't take reservations. We waited almost two hours in a crowded little hallway. Why didn't we walk around the beautiful town of Montclair for that entire time instead you might ask? Because this restaurant has no way of letting you know your table is ready except for the rude teenage girls at the "front" desk which is actually shoved in the back of the restaurant right outside of the kitchen where all the food runners are plowing past you with hot plates. The manager expects you to stand in this cramped little space when you think your time might be drawing near so you can hear it when they call your name. Now the good stuff: Once you sit down, the atmosphere is great! The decor is adorable, the music makes it feel more authentic, and the waiters are friendly and knowledgable. Their many flavors of "sangria" are fantastic; bring your own bottle of wine or liquor to give it an extra alcoholic kick. I can not say enough good things about the food. The last time I had great, authentic Cuban food was in Miami a few years ago, but Cuban Pete's gives those establishments a run for their money. Once we sat down, everything was stellar from start to finish.	4.0
The Skinny: This is a place to go for group outing, family reunions, and for enjoying Cuban food while being infused in the Cuban culture; too loud for a first date, though. Price: mid-range to high Food: excellent quality with Cuban authenticity Atmosphere: fun with Cuban look and feel; family and kids friendly The Long Review The Bad Stuff: Pete's Cuban is a hotspot in Montclair, NJ. Better make reservations and show up 20 minutes in advance so that you can be late enough but not feel overwhelmed by your hunger. They do not offer any free drink or snack if you are waiting for almost 30 minutes or more. Whatever happens, you can always expect a 30-40 minute delay if you go there on a weekend without any reservation during prime-time (6-8pm). The hosts are just not trained to handle huge crowd and their frustrations almost get the better of them. They will be polite but their anxiousness will draw them to borderline rudeness. So, give yourself plenty of time and expect low quality customer service at the gate. The Good Stuff: Pass the gatekeepers and you are in for a good quality service. Let's go over them in three categories: food, dessert, service. Food: Always fresh, and savory. I went there at least twice if not three times and each time, the food was great from presentation to taste. For appetizer we had Goat Cheese Fritters which have walnuts marinated with honey in them. Fresh, delicious, and filling enough to let keep you happy until the main course arrives. For the main course, I had a red snapper crisped and cooked perfectly with mango-veggie bits with coconut rice. Every bite released more flavor that delivered a savoring experience with the coconut rice. It put my mind at ease after the bustling long line and cramped up waiting and made up for it. Dessert: For dessert we had the custard with mango and coco. Rich in taste but soft in sweetness, this dessert has the perfect blend of flavors that release just enough sweetness for you to enjoy each bite and feel as if you are sitting by a tropical beach and savoring the gentle cool breeze on a summer day. Close your eyes, and the Cuban music in the background will take you just there. Service: Except for the host and reception area hustles, the service is excellent. You feel as if you are actually in Cuba. The waiters/waitresses are well versed on the menu. Quiz them on an item and they will give you every bit of details to describe it to your satisfaction. Overall: Pete's Cuban is a fantastic place for couples, families, groups, and kids. Just bring a bottle of water or Gatorade in case you get too hungry while waiting on the line. Go there for the Cuban experience. It's as authentic as it gets in New Jersey.	4.0
My friends and I had the pleasure of enjoying this restaurant TWO TIMES while we were away in New Jersey, 2 weekends ago. We not only found the service absolutely fantastic, but we were received with great pleasure by, whom I believe to be the manager, Dominico, and his staff. The food was, without error, most delectable! I see all of us visiting again from NYC! The ambience is beautiful, from paintings, to beautiful earthy decorations and palm trees. I've never been to Cuba but I can say I certainly didn't feel like I was in Jersey while sitting and eating there!	5.0

I was worried about eating here given some of the recent reviews, but I have to say it was a great experience!   We went on a Wednesday night and had 6:30 reservations, which I'm sure was not nearly as busy as the weekend and all, but we were seated right away, got a great table with plenty of room and the staff was very attentive.  Food was good -- not fantastic, but good.  Good size portions and well prepared.  I had the El Gaucho/Chipotle strip steak which was very good.  Got a side of the coconut rice which was also tasty and we tried the goat cheese fritters, which everyone liked.  I would definitely come here again.	4.0
Went late on a Friday night (around 9pm), and they were crazy busy!! The atmosphere was vibrant and loud, and the food was delicious. There were only 2 of us, but it seemed like a great restaurant for big groups. It's BYOB so you have to bring the wine to put in the sangria, which is a bummer since it's not as good that way. I tried the crispy beef, it was unique and so delicious! The portions are big so go hungry or plan on sharing. Also plan on waiting a bit for a table.	4.0
I had been wanting to try this place for such a long time, but every time I was in Montclair, they had a very long wait, so we would never go.  Finally, I decided to make a reservation one day and go.  It was such a great decision because I loved it. I wish there were more places like this! Once you enter, you do feel like you just left NJ.  If it wasn't so cold, I would have loved to sit outside next to the palm trees.  Inside, it was very loud...this is definitely not a place where you can have a serious conversation.  It's more for a fun night out.  The food was amazing (we all got different entrees and appetizers) and so were the Sangria flavors.  I would highly recommend if you are planning to be in Montclair..Just make sure to make reservations even if you are only two people.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the music was so loud that you had to speak very loudly just to make up for it.	4.0
I gotta say Cuban Pete's is pretty average in my book.   I'm going to chalk it up to prime location but the food here is really pricey.  Perhaps it is the fact that I've spent a lot of time in the JC heights, Union City, North Bergen area in very used to similar quality Cuban/Spanish food at half the price.  Probably unique to Montclair though. That being said, the food is good and they are at your table in a hurry.  I especially liked the rice, it has a vinegary taste to it that works for me.  The steak was good also (even though they cooked it well when I asked for medium.)   We had a variety of the food, desert, appetizers and while none of it was terrible, nothing really blew my socks off though. Gets very crowded, don't come on a cold night during prime eating hours on the weekend or you'll be waiting outside because inside space is limited.	3.0
I really don't know how this place has good reviews. After being hassled to try this place for over a year I finally have it a chance. I shouldn't have... I should've realized I was in for an experience when I realized there was no parking lot (although there is metered parking). I found a parking space and walk in to see two hostesses dancing and giggling at the front desk -_- . Since we arrived at 4 PM there wasn't a wait and we were immediately seated. Once seated it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come over (despite the place being practically empty). When he came over we placed our orders despite not really knowing what we wanted because we knew he wouldn't be back anytime soon. He takes our orders and brings out our drinks a few minutes later. It took about 15 minutes for the appetizers to come and when they did mine was cold on the inside (AMAZINGNESS). At this point I lost all hope for this place. 20 or 25 minutes later our meal comes out. I wish it was worth the wait. I tried everything my party ordered and besides the plantains and the yams EVERYTHING was tasteless. Well, that'a not completely true because salt is a taste. It seems like the chef doesn't know how to season food and uses salt to compensate. The service could be improved a bit given that the food is so terrible. I mean, I was there for 2 hours and only had my 6 oz. glass refilled twice. TIP FOR OWNER - Remove half of the tables (since it's way too tight) and focus on customer service and the quality of food a little more.	1.0
I truly felt the authentic Cuban experience here - even though I've never been to Cuba! From the moment we walked in, we greeted by two friendly hostesses, served by an energetic waiter who knew his menu backwards and forwards, and who you could tell loved working there. He recommended an amazing assortment of tapas - Goat Cheese Fritters, Salt Cod Fritters, and the Queso Frito - Ugh. SO GOOD. The Cuban beef hash wasn't that good; but, I got over it as soon as the succulent, tender and well-flavored Lechon Asado was brought over and sealed the deal. It was a roasted pork and garlic shredded piece of heaven served with white rice and black beans. Classic Cuban. And, did I mention the music was happening? Yeah. It was happening. I was having such a good time, my date and I turned around and started conversation with the table next to us - who were also having a blast! As far as restaurants go - it was a total package deal. Authentic ambiance. Great Service. Amazing Food. Word of advice. Make Reservations ahead of time. The place was PACKED on a Thursday night. I heard Saturday wait times are brutal.	4.0
Ah, Cuban Pete's. Look, it's fun if you don't take it too seriously. And the food is good. Portions are huge. Under the surface, the atmosphere is kitschy and a  little... I don't know, uncomfortable.  High stress.  Always a wait.  The sangria, I'm sorry, is not amazing sangria.  It's more like fruit juice with fruit in it.  Don't expect to have a non-screaming conversation here.  Your server is very likely to disappear for a long time during some point in the meal. I go here to give out-of-town friends a fun party-type dinner experience. But for a truly great restaurant, there are a lot of other, better places in Montclair.	3.0
Came here around 4pm on Memorial Day (Monday), we were seated pretty quickly.  The place was very busy.  We had a great waiter, Anthony, who explained that it was BYOB but recommended the Watermelon "Mojito".  Delicious.  We had a couple tapas items (chicken wings, tostones, and bolinhos d bacalo) and for our meals, the whole red snapper and a cuban sandwich, all were delicious.  The service, for us, was very good.  Maybe during peak times it can be a bit off.	4.0
My favorite food was the Popsicle Chicken and Red Snapper.	5.0
As hundreds of others have commented, food is good, but speed of service is really,really bad. Our server was very accommodating, but not attentive. However he was servicing over 10 tables by himself!!! Also the food runner was noticeably going to the wrong table each time he had food.  Our entire meal was sat down on the table of other patrons before I interrupted saying it was our food.  It is definitely worth a trip to NYC if you want a good Cuban meal and not settling for it in Montclair.	3.0
Delicious food, good waiters, horrible customer service from the manager/owner? on a busy Saturday. I went last night to celebrate my Birthday and saw many people leave because the wait was ridiculously long (no reservations on Friday/Sat), and because of the lack of tact from the owner. As I was standing next to the hostess booth I heard the owner describe people by their skin color. I was the only person of color with my group and when we were finally called to be seated after a long wait, the owner decides to make a joke and say 'Are all these white people with you?' What the hell does that have to do with anything and how is that in any way professional? The last thing that you want to hear after waiting hours to sit is a smart mouthed comment from someone who is supposed to be providing me with costumer service. Delicious food, but the owner is a douche!	3.0
The 2 stars is due to service, and service alone. I went for dinner last night and probably had the worst service experience of my life. Our waiter barely said hello to us, took about 10 minutes to walk up to our table/open our wine (to which he DID NOT pour us a glass, he simply just put the bottle on the table) and take our order. I asked for a small modification on my dinner, to which he gave me an attitude for and barely acknowledged my request...The next time we saw him was literally to ask for the check....When I got my food the modification I asked for was not done for me, so the entree came as is. Since our waiter was MIA, I couldn't tell him what was wrong. As my annoyance was growing by the second, I was constantly reminded how my water glass remained empty throughout our entire meal, because, again,  he never came by once to see how our dinner was. If I hadn't spent time as a waitress during my college days, this guy would've gotten a VERY small tip. He's lucky I have a guilty conscience. I would be hard pressed to come back here again. It's unfortunate because the food is decent, the prices are cheap, and it's a fun atmosphere.	1.0
Awesome Place to go with friends and family!! Just go before 4:00 so you do not have to wait!! Great atmosphere and great food!! W	5.0
Not extremely familiar with Cuban food, but this place made me a fan! It's clearly a local favorite and can get a little crowded; however, the food seems authentic and it's certainly delicious...well worth the wait. There's no space that goes unused, so be prepared to sit close to the next table or right in the middle of a busy walk-way. If you can look beyond the configuration, you will enjoy an awesome meal!	4.0
Racist, abusive, nasty owner. Below average food. Overcrowded, super loud. Do yourself a favor and AVOID this place like The Plague. BOYCOTT! We waited 90 mins for a table on a Friday @ 6:30pm, after being told 30 mins. Then when the owner/manager called our group of 5, he brought us back with another group of 8. It was very confusing and we were a mixed-up line of 13 people weaving thru spaces too small for a child. When we got to the back, he pointed to me from 15 feet away and I motioned to a 6-top table to ask if it was for us. Not realizing what party I was with, he corrected me and brought me to a tiny table for 4. When i mentioned that were 5 people, he got angry and told me to go back to the front and wait some more. I said "but sir, you called our name and brought us back here", he grew twice as angry and started shouting at me "GO BACK TO THE FRONT AND WAIT". I said, "But I don't understand, you personally brought us here!?". Not realizing that he had already sat a few of my friends from the front of the line at a teeny tiny table meant for 3 ppl max. He then literally screamed at the top of his lungs at me "GO BACK NOW!!!" Completely shocked, I said "Why are you talking to me like this?", to which he replied "YOU'RE OUTTA HERE, GET OUT OF MY RESTAURANT!!" About 5 staff members stood around with a knowing look on their face, just shaking their heads. I asked one waiter "What's with that guy?" to which he replied "Well he's the owner, he just does whatever he wants". At this point I realized that he didn't know I was with the few ppl he had sat around the corner already, so 2 of us followed him and tried to explain. He then threatened us both with physical violence. No joke. "DO YOU WANNA GET YOUR ASS KICKED? Leave now or I will get the Mexicans from the kitchen to come out here at beat the sh** out of you" Nothing like a shocking display of racism mixed with the threat of violence to make your birthday celebration extra special. If that's what your looking for, Cuban Pete's if your place! As we all walked out (3 guys, 2 girls) he cursed at the females, and told the one guy with us who was latino "See what happens when you make friends with Gringos??" I've worked for years in both casual and fine-dining restaurants, and I've never seen ANYONE treated this way. And a lot of fellow Yelpers have similar reviews for this place. The food is not good either, its just passable... why would you subject your friends and family to this, and why support this crazy, racist, abusive man? With a line out the door, he doesn't value any customers whatsoever. BOYCOTT!	1.0
Several friends have recommended Cuban Pete's so we decided to try it out a couple months ago and foolishly chose a Saturday night without calling ahead for reservations; not wanting to wait the estimated two hours we instead discovered a great Thai place across the street (brief disappointment followed by a bonus!) Nevertheless, we tried again on a Wednesday evening and I'm glad we persevered. Glorious Cuban foods and a relaxing picturesque setting on a warm spring night; it doesn't get much better! The giant portion of roast pork was perfectly seasoned and came with a generous serving of red beans and rice, and sinfully sweet grilled plantains. I also sampled the skirt steak which was tender and delicious. We left satiated but immediately curious to discover the other menu items. Even on a weeknight the large dining area filled up quickly and some of the wait staff seemed disorganized as things got busier. However, our waiter was attentive and efficient. We're definitely coming back to explore the menu but will be sure to make reservations the next time we go on a weekend.	4.0
Nice little neighborhood in Montclair. Cuban Petes is a nice restaurant w an awesome ambiance. The lighting is just right. Staff super attentive. Food is what u expect, amazing! Last time a was here i had their skirt steak w coconut rice, perfection! Juicy and Flavorful! Paella was just right according to my girl! The tres leches is to die for!	4.0
The food alone is pretty good, but the service on a busy night is SO incredibly bad I can't give it more than 2 stars. Had two horrible experiences and the last time I went here we literally were not helped until 45 mins after we were seated. So we just sat there and drank our entire bottle of wine when finally someone asked us if we were being helped...we just left. The food IS tasty so I recommend coming on a random week night.	2.0
Not really sure what all the hype is about. This place is average at best. The atmosphere is cool- I get that. The prices are great with good portions- that's a plus but the food is just OK. And the place gets veryyyy busy and they don't take reservations which doesn't help! LONG waits.	3.0
I hate to bash a place but this has to be said: this place needs to learn to take reservations and get more organized. Also, when you have guests on a waiting list, you should have an actual list to work off of. It looked like the owner was throwing out random times at random people. The owner told us that we had 40 minutes to wait. We waited right outside the front doors because the inside was jam packed with people. We asked again, told to wait a little longer. We finally went in after an hour and the owner said we were next. Then, he comes back to us and had the audacity to say that we "disappeared" and therefore, had to wait another hour on top of what we waited. I argued with him about it but he couldn't even care less. What was worse was how many people were jam packed into the waiting area. The wait staff was trying to juggle multiple plates around everyone. I think my hair got in someone's food a few times when a waiter surprisingly showed up behind me. I watched the waiter even serve that dish after my hair had dipped itself in it. On top of that, the wait staff was so hurried in the loud restaurant, that they would even drop whole dishes. It was a mess in there. We just left and found a better, more organized restaurant up the street. The owner has to take control, learn to take proper reservations. I have seen other reviews where people are having the same issues. That night alone, I watched people walk in, curse at the hectic mess that was before them and walked out. If Gordon Ramsey ever saw this place, he'd be screaming at them to get their act together. But I have to give it to them, at least the owner's got a packed house so he feels he can treat customers like crap I guess.	1.0
The food is good I will give them that but the wait staff at times can be rude.  I don't know if it is a spanish thing but those women in there even though are attractive they don't smile much.  Kind of puts you off for a second.  I thought being spanish myself that women are usually attentive, well not at Cuban Pete's.  I will probably go again but only if I am out voted.	3.0
Great food, loud fun atmosphere and BYO combine to make this a winner for all parties big and small. Its super loud so I wouldn't recommend it for a date night. Other yelpers have criticized this place for not taking reservations and not knowing how long the wait would be here,telling some people 1 hr, 2hrs, etc.  Here is the truth and a super helpful tip. They know exactly how long the wait is and IT'S NEVER 2HRS. Truth be told they have no waiting area and when they tell you 2 hours they want you to leave. Get it. The place gets so much traffic they know they'll fill the tables as soon as they open up so they'd rather you just leave than clog up the limited space they have.  If your whole party is there and you stick around for 15 -20 minutes, you'll get a table regardless of how long they tell you the wait is. Do not even bother going up to the hostess stand and putting your name down if your whole party isn't there. With a seating game like this they should call it Sneaky Cuban Pete's ...now you can beat them at their own game.	4.0
The food is good but there are too many politics to eat here!   *The hosteses have an attitude problem - they act like they are working at one of the hottest spots in NYC or LA. Reality check bitches, this is NJ and the restaurant is not a glamourous celebrity hot spot! *The wait is ridiculous - don't go there hungry! I know ppl make reservations to restaurants and don't show up but that is why some restaurants take credit cards with reservations  and will give away your table if you are not there 10 mins prior. Not rocket science, start taking reservations!! *Even if only 1 person from your party is missing they won't seat you - I refer back to 'this is not NYC or LA'.  They wouldn't let us sit and order appetizers (see why below) and Sangria, while waiting for ONE person. *You cannot order appetizers first while you decide on your main course - Mind you after waiting an hour, you are starving and would like to start w ordering something that will come quickly, while you study the menu!!! *They are always out of something - ALWAYS! There are too many rules to eat here and this is why I won't go back.  Isn't the restaurant supposed to cater to me?  Whatever happened to customer service!! Too much crap to deal with to eat here, when there are so many other amazing restaurants in Monclair that don't have so many RULES!!!	2.0
Love love love the food! Papa rellena appetizers are a must! along with the Churrasco (skirt steak)	5.0
I went there on a Sunday at 5pm for an early dinner. I asked for a table for two, the wait was 15 minutes. Literally 10 seconds later there was another couple who asked for a table for two and was told 1 hour. We actually waited 30 mins, but its better than a family of four being told 2 hours. I am pretty sure they have no idea the wait time is. They just seem to panic and tell everyone an hour...and people do. Yes, its jam packed inside, and outside is usually reserved for large groups, unless they are flooded with groups of 3 or 4 people, then they let people sit outside. The food is really good. Everything we ordered was neatly prepared and cooked to perfection. Took a bite of my pork chop and it was cooked so well that I stopped caring about my elbows hitting the lady at the table next to me. Took a bite of the yuca potato and totally didn't care about the loud music and annoying happy birthday song that they scream at unsuspecting customers in a language that they don't understand. We had sangria as well. Yes, the place is BYOB, which isn't a bad thing if you are looking to save some cash. So buy a six pack or a bottle of wine and bring it there. They put your beer in a bucket of ice too, so you don't have to worry about your beer going warm during your potential 3 hour wait. Oh the sangria is made from your own wine, so choose wisely. And it costs around 16 dollars for their sangria mixture. Overall, its a nice place if you like a long wait, loud atmosphere, amazing food, and good service.	3.0
We had read great things about the food here, and the food was good. Unfortunately the atmosphere was not what we would have hoped for at all. We had a ridiculous wait and it was a Monday night. We eventually got seated in a back corner in a room that was so lough you couldn't really talk to your family members. It was horrendously loud, that was a couple of years ago and I will not go back. My 20 year old son liked it, so if noise and a long wait doesn't bother you, you will probably enjoy the food.	2.0
I have been wanting to go to Cuban Pete's for quite some time, and I went last week with a friend who had just moved to Montclair.  I can't comment on the cocktail mixers, as we brought beer, but I hope to try them next time. I had the chicken ropa vieja, mostly because I've always wanted to try ropa vieja but do not eat beef (usually the only variety).  It was great!  The portion was very generous (I really had enough left for lunch the next day), and the chicken was tender and flavorful.  The rice and beans were good, and the maduros were outstanding - a bit well-done/extra caramelized, just the way I love them. I had a salad as an app that had jicama, papaya, mango, and carrot over mixed greens, with a coconut dressing.  That was all good, but it didn't come with the cilantro and mint that were listed on the menu, so it was basically a pile of fruit and lettuce.  I only ate half anyway, and the staff packed me two small containers of cilantro and mint to use on the leftovers (tip: speak up sooner than I did, if this happens to you, because the complete medley of flavors was fabulous). Service was a bit spotty (especially for water refills), and the piercing sound of the birthday drums really did hurt my ears quite a bit, but I am still a big fan of the tasty food, large portions, atmosphere, and overall value.	4.0
I love this place!! The lechon is delicious and the staff is always very friendly.  The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because it is so loud that you have to yell for anybody you are with to hear you.  Overall though really good experience.	4.0
Busy place, very loud, awesome food! Best place for Cuban food hands down	4.0
I'd heard about Cuban Pete's for a while and was excited to try it out to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It was a Saturday evening around 8ish and the birthday girl was told there was an hour wait when she gave her name to the hostess.  The wait turned out to be double that, and the manager admitted that if it weren't for my final check in with the hostess almost 2 hours later, we never would have gotten a table due to her disorganization. After we were finally seated at a crunched, cater-cornered table in the small "annex" of the restaurant, we started drinking our BYOB wine (too desperate for a drink at that point to wait for their over priced sangria mixture).  We ordered a variety of entrees, some ordered fish, others meat (ropa vieja/churrasco).  I ordered the pollo cubano.  The food came out rather quickly.  My chicken was pretty flavorful and tender and the maduros were sweet and tasty.  However, 3 out of the 5 of us there were Latina and all agreed that the beans were over salted and under cooked.  Really, a CUBAN restaurant can't get the black beans right?  I also didn't like that they served us the beans family-style- that just screams laziness towards the end of the evening. Every time we asked for water, they would bring one- yes, one- glass to the whole table.  We were very packed in and right on top of the customers next to us.  We could also barely hear eachother; my friend asked if they could lower the music and they refused.  In all, too long of a wait for mediocre food and sub-par service/accommodations.  There are plenty of other cool places in the area and surely better Cuban restaurants within a 25 minute vicinity (North Bergen, Elizabeth, etc.)	2.0
The food and the service was great- would absolutely recommend the paella. I was delighted when he called me "sir" even though I am clearly too young to be referred to as "sir". The cons are that the restaurant was very loud, the seats were in close proximity to other customers eating and it was a bit of a wait early in the evening. Oh yea, and the black beans weren't that great.	3.0
OK.  I will attempt to keep this short n sweet: Cons: Very tight.  I dont mind busy or waiting a half hour to be seated on a busy Saturday night, but damn, the waiters are running around like chickens w/ the heads cut off hustling (which we all should appreciate) but try a bit harder not to bump into my chair :) Pros: Service was fine, no problems Price - No problem, very reasonable Portions -bigger than average Food - Excellent, everything from the apps to the meal!  Very good!  Nothing frozen from what i could taste! Good food man, believe the hype!	4.0
The food was wonderful but the wait was a circus. Pushed around, elbowed, run over, crowded and forgotten :: and we were told it gets worse in the summer. Tip to Owner:  I'd soooo suggest you Sign up for one of those noWait apps and get a bit more tech savvy so customers aren't being abused just to get the chance to eat.~ an iPad for your hostess and a txt msg when your tables ready would solve this problem in one day.	3.0
I am a huge fan of Cuban Petes.  There are only two complaints... 1) they don't sell liquor. You can bring your own bottle and they can even mix it for you, but don't think for a second that when you order the mojitos that there is liquor in it.. there ISN'T.  2) it's so popular you will have to wait and it's crowd 8 out of 10. I absolutely love the ambiance and décor of this place. The entrance makes you forget that you're even in Jersey. I've never been to Cuba, but between the décor , the uniforms and the Spanish beats it feels like I'm at least out of country. The food is DELICIOUS! Growing up with Spanish food I'm VERY particular about it, but this food is GOOD. I can't recommend this place enough.	5.0
The first two times I went the food was average at best. I went back a third. The kitchen was out of two out of the three appetizers we ordered, but we were never informed because the waiters were switching shifts while we were there. When I finally got my entree it was inedibly salty. This is the only time I have ever sent my food back at any restaurant. The only thing that gives this place two stars is the friendly server. He seemed embarrassed over all of the mistakes that were made. I'll get my sangria elsewhere.	2.0
loud. long wait at the door. lots of little cuban guys pushing you around while you wait. however, the food is delicious.	3.0
I've been here on different occasions. This is such a nice spot. It's very popular, but also very large and usually the wait isn't long unless it's a Fri/Sat night. The girls and I went for late lunch. As always food was amazing! Unfortunately the waiter, an older man, was for lack of a better word a miserable fart. I understand the hustle and bustle as it was crowded that afternoon but dude, seriously you don't have to pour our wine like your pumping gas! He was inpatient, inattentive and rude when we asked about the sangria selections. Fortunately they aren't all like that, some are actually young n hot ;) In spite of the lack of courtesy from our server (who we still tipped well) we still really did enjoy ourselves. We knocked back a few, excellent food, and cool atmosphere. Sex in the city moment achieved!	4.0
It's a good place, the food is good with a great party atmostphere.  If you're looking for somewhere with open space, some quiet conversation or just to be alone. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE! But crowded restaurants usually mean the food and service is good.  It was a packed house when I was there on the weekend, near dinner and I received my food hot and within a reasonable amount of time. the food and service is about the best in Montclair, and it's a great town to walk around in.	3.0
I LOVE CUBAN PETE'S. Best Cuban food ever, one of my favorite places to eat, it's a BYOB so you can drink their delicious sangria and drink whatever you bring. The food is so delicious and the food comes out so quickly. I love the ambiance too. Love, love, love. Get the oxtails!	5.0
Def hyped up. Super disorganized. Food is not fresh and everyone is ontop of eachother. First and last time	1.0
First of all I would like to say that the food was delicious and plentiful.  Also our waiter was great, attentive but not over bearing and had good menu suggestions. I am giving only 3 stars because of the hostess who helped seat us.  We got to the restaurant at 6pm on a Thursday night.  We were taking our adult children out for my son's birthday. (there was 5 of us)  Anyway, when we got there the place was relatively empty but they tried seating us in a side building that we had to go outside across a courtyard to access.  It was so cold inside and the first table she offered us was right next to the door.  We asked to sit away from the door and got a little attitude from her.  After sitting down we realized it was just too cold in this outer buildingso we went back across the courtyard and asked to be seated inside the main building.  After some eye rolling the hostess had the nerve to tell us we would have to wait for a table.  My daughter asked her how long the wait was but since there were so many open tables the hostess  had to seat us.  She was soooo rude and I wanted to complain right away to the manager but my kids didn't want a scene and I didn't want to ruin the night.  Having said all this we did have a great time but the management should know how unprofessional their hostess behaved  Also the music is fun but a little too loud.	3.0
This place does deserve the good ratings and I will explain why. First off its a BYOB you can get drunk with your own liquor. The apps were amazing especially this shrimp tapas and the stuffed plantains, simply awesome. I ordered the charusco steak and it came with the rice and beans and it was very flavorful. They were huge portions to I was stuffed after it was all said and done. Also, it was my friends birthday so the guys came out with the drums and started singing for her and dancing. This all happened on a normal Tuesday night so the weekends must be even better. This spot is probably one of the best Cuban spots in Jersey.	4.0
Cuban Pete's is just great. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun and high-energy, and the service is unbeatable. Wait can get long on the weekends, and be prepared to wait a WHILE if it's nice out. This place is perfect for nice weather -- you could sit out on the patio!	4.0
Without a doubt, Cuban Pete's is one of the most popular restaurants in Montclair... if not THE most popular restaurant in Montclair. The food is delicious, and most dishes come with sides of coconut rice (yum!) or fired platanos (double yum!). The sangria / mojito menu is extensive, although there's been some talk about how "legitimate" the sangria is since Cuban Pete's doesn't have a liquor license. Food can take a bit to come out if they're busy, but that's understandable. My fave dishes are Chicken Carlito's Way and the Ropa Viejo. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the tres leches cake. I removed a star for NOT having a reservation system. Cuban Pete's is long known for having 1 hr + waits on weekend nights, and even long waits during some weeknights. I understand that supply & demand let's them get away with not having a reservation system, but this place is super popular for large groups... and not being able to plan when everyone can finally sit can be a pain. Usually, we send one or two people to go ahead and put the group's name down, and then tell everyone to meet at Cuban Pete's 30 minutes after that time point... but God forbid everyone ISN'T there when they finally call you to sit, as they won't seat you. Even so, if you can deal with the wait, this place is great for a birthday or a group dinner. It's a got fun vibe, great energetic ambiance, friendly service, and delicious, satisfying food. I would say it ISN'T good for a meal where you want to catch up with a friend, or an intimate date, because it is simply TOO loud and crowded for that. I hadn't seen a friend for a few months and suggested Cuban Pete's, but I couldn't hear her travel stories due to the din in the restaurant. Yet, we had my sister's 21st birthday here, and it was a blast. I've been to Cuban Pete's a ton of times throughout the years, and will probably to continue to go when I get back to Montclair. Viva Cuban Pete's!	4.0
ambiance is awesome with lively colors and beach theme, great food, great sangria and always a fun night! just make sure you make a reservation!	4.0
The best Cuban restaurant I have ever been to. This is a place where you can go with a date, a group of friends or with your family. Their food is really delicious & bursting with flavor. Order anything on their menu and you can't go wrong. My favorite however is their Oxtail stew... very tender and really yummy! The ambience inside is very lively and it can be too loud sometimes but it's ok, it's a part of the "Cuban" experience! :) Best part is, you can bring your own bottle of booze! I always bring a bottle of red or white wine and order a carafe of their sangria, yum! Great service too! It can be really crowded even on midweek's dinner time ( because that's how awesome this place is). So I always try to come before 6pm to avoid long waits.  This is a great restaurant that I always look forward going to.	5.0
I went here this pass sunday 3/3/13, The food was great, the service was nice and the servers were very knowledgeable about the menu. The owner was very kind n make sure we had a great table, Being a spanish women coming to this place made me feel at home. I Loved the decor, the atmosphere and the location. The only reason why i gave it a 4star was because their was no waiting area. when its packed and your standing waiting to be seated theres no where to really to stand, serves were come by you with food, people walking in n out. It jus got alil uncomfortable but besides that i will recommend you checking out this place. Ooh the mango mojo 5stars	4.0
I'm in disbelief this place has received so many raves. The atmosphere is absolutely   Amazing, ill give em that.. But the food is gross, it looks and tastes like the cooked it in the morning and kept it warm all day, the service is hit or miss. I feel like what people love about this place is the BYOB, sangrias and the experience.. But if you take all that away the nom noms are positively foul!	1.0
Do not go here if you want a nice, quiet meal.  This place is LOUD.  With that said, the food is delicious, especially anything with steak.  The decor and the service staff uniforms (complete with fedoras) are great and really give the place a flavor all its own.	4.0
Food was excellent! We had to wait like 30 minutes on a week night to be seated but once we were it was really great service. Nice atmosphere. Tapas were really good! I would definitely go back for another round.	4.0
Awesome place...love the appetizers (great empanadas and mini cuban sandwiches are delicious) great entrees (beef stew, ropa vieja, chimichurri sauce over skirt steak (my favorite) and the service was very friendly!  There is normally a long wait that is well worth it.  The manager is excellent and he will always try his best to accommodate you. We had a group of six and they initially said it'd be a 2 hour wait but then they managed to get us a table much sooner. Highly recommend this place!	5.0
Beans had very little flavor, ropa vieja was too salty, service was slow, churrasco tasted burnt (may be the grill wasn't cleaned off?)	2.0
My favorite cuban restaurant to to eat at! The chicken lollipops and empanada appetizers are good. The flounder in a garlic bath is exceptional and the pulled beef is delicious! The energy in there is always awesome and the waiter are nice and very helpful. Its BYOB which is cool and they will mix your drinks for you. I love going here for a business lunch, intimate dinner or drinks and appetizers with the girls. Really busy on weekends and summer nights so plan ahead!	5.0
As a NYer, I'm still struggling to deal with the lack of alcohol served in NJ restaurants. Had the Carlitos Way chicken(lol, great reference) with the coconut rice, which was definitely tasty but the place was super loud, with speakers blasting music everywhere. The service was irritating, everytime we wanted something we had to wait and flag down the waiter or he would ignore us for a long period of time. The mojitos were ok, but without rum or something else it tasted like sugar water, way too sweet and sugary.	3.0
Awesome food. Great service and Atmosphere. The owner goes out of his way to make you feel welcomed. Top 5 spot in Bergen.	5.0
I have been here a few times and have usually had very good experiences. Last night was an exception. It wasn't because of service, because they were very nice, hospitable and fast. Maybe a little too fast actually, because it felt so busy and a bit rushed at times. No real complaints there though. The bigger disappointment was the food and drinks. Maybe I have a bad memory, but I don't remember them being BYO. The Mojitos tasted like pure sour mix. Big disappointment. The appetizers were ok, but not mind blowing. We had the goat cheese fritters and stuffed plantains. The dinner was the bigger disappointment. I had the mango skirt steak, which didnt taste anything like mango. There was supposed to be mango salsa with it and it was literally two small pieces of mango on the plate. The steak itself was soft and juicy, but not all that tasty. Just steak...nothing special. The coconut rice just tasted like rice and the yams were just yams. The dessert was pretty bad too. The tres leches was only wet and soft at the bottom. The top was completely dry. And again nothing special. Bottom line is this place went from having great food to just ok food. Not horrible, but certainly not special and probably not worth the drive and certainly not worth a wait in line.	2.0
Went on Christmas Eve with my mom who wanted to celebrate by having a traditional Cuban meal. The entrance to the restaurant leads you through a path and into the outdoor patio which is really nice and makes a great space for outdoor meals during the warmer months. Upon walking in you are greeted by somewhat of an overload on decor; fake palm trees, waiters in the traditional Cuban guayabera shirts and hats and loud music. We were seated right away. Already this place was a +1 in my book, BYO! We looked over the extensive menu as our waiter quickly came by and opened our wine bottles and decided on 2 apps, the Piquillo Relleno (Piquillo peppers stuffed with sausage and fried plantains) and Ham Croquettes. Both were very good. There were 7 small croquettes in the order and the peppers were roasted nicely, sweet and savory with a cream sauce. There are 3 different sections to the menu. Classic Cuban with the favorites such as Ropa Vieja and Lechon Asado; Viejo Cuban with lesser known dishes with standard sides and the Nuevo Cuban for dishes with a twist. I chose the Churrasco Mambo Kings and Mom went with Lechon Asado . My skirt steak was a very large portion (I ate 2 meals) cooked to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sugarcane mojito glaze, very tender and incredible tasty. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the side of a sweet potato and rice which lacked in the coconut flavor described. My mom's Lechon Asado was amazing. A massive portion (she had 3 meals with it) of succulent roast pork with congris (mixed black beans and rice) and a side of fried plantains. For dessert we shared the Tres Leches cake, sponge cake soaked in 3 different milks topped with a meringue, another unfortunate miss. Aside from that we thoroughly enjoyed the night. The food was plentiful for an incredible price (bill was $54!), the service was friendly and on point and the atmosphere was very lively and festive. The waiters break into song and dance playing instruments so this is not a place if you are looking for a quiet meal but we wanted to celebrate the holiday so it was welcome.	4.0
Great food and good service. Every person I have taken there loves the place!	4.0
Since I have known my bf, he has told me that we were going to come here, but for some reason we have never made our way here (even though he only lives about 15 minutes away). We just always drove by and it seemed to be packed every time! Finally, on a random Monday afternoon we came in here for lunch. Of course, it was empty because it was only 4pm. SERVICE- Gracious, hospitable, and fast! DECOR- Authentic and inviting! FOOD- Extremely flavorful! DRINKS- Tasty! (no free refills on the lemonade or iced tea though =/ ) I can't wait to go back and try more food! Especially in the summer!	4.0
Was with a large group..Loved sitting outside in the quaint courtyard for dinner!  (inside can be CRAZY NOISY & BUSY).  The Sangria was really good...The entire table shared a bunch of appetizers, all were recommended by our server and she was spot on!!  My main entree was the Seafood Paella (as did some others) mine was the only one a little dry.... but overall flavor was good... Here's the deal... If you are looking for the ambiance of a "quiet conversation" I don't think this is the place!  The line of people on the inside waiting for a table is a bit uneasy (like they're watching you eat)- Overall if you're in the mood for very good Cuban food & savings of a BYOB... this is a winner!!   FYI Parking can be a nightmare, so be warned!	4.0
Honestly I thought this place would be better considering all the hype and the amount of business Cuban Pete's does. The food was interesting but lacked the punch of flavor I expect from Cuban food. We opted to stick to the tapas menu so we could try as much as possible. The best part was the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon and drizzled with honey. I think that's about it, a lot of the food could have used more moisture and flavor. Maybe we were just unlucky. We will probably go back at some point and try again.	3.0
Well, my girlfriend and I finally decided to go here after years of meaning to visit. We've heard so much hype about this place that, we were very excited to go. The wait wasn't too long. We went at around 7 pm on a Thursday. The maître d' was a little abrasive and almost rude, but hey, sometimes that's the atmosphere and style one is paying for,but I didn't think Cubans are known for being rude, abrasive or, "in your face". We were seated with a bit of confusion so we ended up getting a pretty good tour of the interior. The design is splendid and the energy was fantastic. The loud, ethnic music and energy piqued our interests for the food. We couldn't wait! The non-alcoholic drinks were amazing and our salads came out quickly. With excitement and enthusiasm, we dove right in!  The salads were mediocre at best. That's the truth. If one has any food experience at a restaurant or visiting great restaurants, I feel that they would be disappointed with the salads; they're okay. Despite our average salads, we were excited about our tapas-style entrees. Yum, right? Again, we couldn't wait! Unfortunately, the food came out way before we even  made a dent in our salads. It felt like the waiter was trying to turnover our table to get us out more quickly; not impressed with the service. Generally, the service was also average at best. When the food did arrive, we noticed it was very dry and over done. Almost as if the food, "died in the window". Did the waiter put the whole order in the computer at the same time to expedite our departure, forcing the salads and tapas to be made at the exact same time thus, leaving us disappointed with the delivery? Whether or not the food was prepared poorly or the poor service contributed to the food losing it's appeal, the meal was unimpressive to say the least...all of it. Not one of our tapas were good and we ordered six. In conclusion, Cuban Pete's is overrated. The hype is just that...hype. The service was just--okay--so, one would expect the food to be amazing...yes? The food was not good at all and I love Cuban food! I would save your money and go somewhere else. I wouldn't even recommend trying this place. I was perplexed as to why all of the high ratings yet, our experience was awful. Not to sound pretentious, however in my opinion, the clientele wasn't too sophisticated or savvy. They seemed impressed by the music and the energy. Perhaps the high raters have no idea about good Cuban food or there has been a recent management change. It seemed like the seemingly average guests, loved the below average food, then talked about it. Don't be fooled.	2.0
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Took my husband here for his birthday this past January .The food was great. We were seated immediately. The staff was friendly and attentive. Didn't have time to grab up a bottle of wine from home (BYOB) but no worries ,the delicious Sangria sufficed.... On returning here with friends bottleSSS in hand :) seating was not so prompt. But in all fairness it was a Friday night. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I spent my time anticipating utilizing the outdoor seating. I can't wait till it warms up to experience this place inside and out!!!	4.0
Love it!!!	3.0
I haven't been here for a few years---used to work in Montclair and honestly those 2 years gave me enough Montclair to last for a long time but since we were attending a show at the Wellmont and we had a group of people we thought Cuban Pete's would be a good pick. They've expanded since I was here last, taking over a room to the right if you are coming in from the street--this is good they can def use extra seating, the place is packed in the summers especially for outdoor seating. They are BYOB which is a great aspect--we brought a few sixpacks, they chilled them for us and opened all the bottles--servers are always pretty friendly. I was actually surprised we had a party of 8 and only 2 people were there and they sat them--this is odd for most restaurant but especially there. Since the weather was crappy and it was early they weren't busy, I assume that's why they allowed it. They don't take reservations which is kind of crappy because it would have been helpful but whatever it is what it is. We opted for a few rounds of tapas rather than dinners, their dinners are fantastic but they do give you a ginormous amount of food so unless you're ravenous be prepared to be taking some home. We ordered everything from empanadas, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese fritters, chimichurri ribs, chorizo, and various potato meat dumplings. Everything was fairly delicious, sometimes a bit repetitive--like the potato meat dumplings. I'm not sure what the description of them was specifically but they kind of all tasted the same and I think we ordered at least 2 different kinds....don't get me wrong, delicious, just similar. The chorizo was fantastic, tostones w some kind of delicious meat. It was really all fantastic. They added tip for us at the end and with everything it came to $35 per couple (for 8 of us, maybe 3-4 tapas per person). So we enjoyed a fantastic and fun meal for a good price and convenient for where we were going. A couple of tips--the sangria is good but IMO it's extremely overpriced. $14 for juice with 5% alcohol--just bring your wine and beer and be happy with it unless you like $14 juice. The food is fantastic, maybe order some tapas and split a dinner? or do double dinners and bring it home, it's just a lot of food. If you go in the summer during prime dinner hours be prepared for a wait. I doubt that the extra room added will alleviate the wait. If it's someones birthday they will literally come out and assault you with bongos, so be aware of that if whoever you are with doesn't like attention---otherwise it's hilarious. The atmosphere is fun and fairly loud, probably not a good romantic date place but all in all a good time!	5.0
Good atmosphere.  Tasty Sangria (white and red).  Bountiful plates of tantalizing meaty treats.   Good experience.	4.0
I'm not an expert on Cuban food at all, and there may or may not be a better place for authentic Cuban food in some other restaurants but this place is definitely a hit with my stomach. Among most of my Filipino friends, this place is great and really hits close to home in terms of other ethnic cuisine that can be related to our own Filipino cuisine. I came here two times: one with a group of friends and another time with a girl I liked at the time. I would recommend going with a group only because the atmosphere better suits for groups as it can get incredibly loud there, especially on the weekends. When I was on that date, it was impossible to understand what we were saying to each other so Cuban Pete's isn't a place to have a romantic dinner date to be honest. The two times I went, it was in the fall/winter so I never got the chance to eat outside but I'll be sure to do that this coming spring/summer.   The food here is top notch. Everything on the menu is worth trying at least once and the sangrias are pretty good, and I'm not even much of a sangria type of person anyway. From where I'm from, Cuban Pete's is a far drive for me so I don't have the luxury of eating here often but I've been dying to come back here soon. I'm just dreaming about those fried bananas. I think they subtly make any dish that much more delicious. I would definitely recommend the lechon asado. The flavor of the lechon asado is out of this world. The service here is great, too. The time I went with a group, our waiter made sure to get everyone's order correct and precise. Not many waiters/waitresses do that nowadays when it comes to big groups so it was nice to see. Definitely would recommend this to people that love a fun atmosphere along with great food.	4.0
Great personable service, amazing true cuban food, loud music. But not for everyone. Love it or hate it. Skirt steak and coconut rice was amazing!	4.0
came in a friday night, we had to wait, but no problem, it wasn't long a wait. second time here the food was super good, paella 16.99... so worth the money did i mention it was very very very good? minus one star: was a tat salty, i chugged about half a gallon of water when i got home, but that's how good the food was, so so good, even though so so salty don't forget to get a mojitos pitcher. there are a lot of flavors, we got the mango mojitos. it was very good. the fresh mint leaves are a nice twist. they don't put a lot of alcohol in there so don't hesitate to order a regular pitcher, even for just 2 people. plus you're gonna be hungry waiting for the food for sure, so it's nice to have something awesome to drink. but again, the food was so worth the wait. the atmosphere is so so so so loud. maybe i should take another star off. maybe. but i kind of know it was gonna be like that. this time it was extra loud though, thanks to all the ladies sitting at the table behind me. i did not even want to lean back on my chair OMG. suggestion: no reservations allowed as of now. they should do reservation with a credit card. i would like to reserve a table, not just for availability's sake, but also for reservation at a the quiet section, so that we didn't have to leave with sore vocal chords.	4.0
Cuban Petes it is a very loud and entertaining place to eat. The cuban food is very good, plus priced rightly. Be Reminded that is BYOB (a thing that you only find in NJ) however across the street there is a liquor store with plenty of booze to bring in. The only issue is that it is very loud and since it is cheap, it is a prime place for bdays which brings the waiters with a drum and make as much loud as possible. That is ok with one bday but 4 or 5 is the norm. However, I think the place is great for good low key food/date. I recommend it.	4.0
The overall rating for this restaurant is 4 stars! Four Freaking stars!?!?!? How? Did I miss something? We arrive Cuban Pete's before the night-time rush and are seated quickly. Instead of being seated in the main room, we get seated somewhere out back; meaning we had to go back outside and enter a different area. I immediately get offended because I felt like we were relegated to the shit section. So we sit in the NIP (not-important-people) section, which reminded me of a a grade school cafeteria. The tables were close together and we were packed in there nice and tight. I definitely needed a drink to douse my initial annoyance, but sike, it's BYOB and hubby and I had no idea.  Too bad we ordered our "mojito" before realizing this. Shame on you Cuban Pete's for advertising mint flavored water as a mojito. I looked longingly at our neighbors who clearly knew the byob rule and had Bacardi handy. I almost forgot my manners and asked to pilfer some... The NIP section was disappointment #1, the "mojito" was disappointment #2 and the menu was disappointment number 3. It was soooo overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. So many freaking options but nothing that stood out and made me go, "yes, I am definitely having this!. Normally options are good but too many options at a restaurant scares me. They were all crammed together and made my eyes cross. Why are you able to have so many options? With some seasonal and some not. Chances are my order was in a freezer somewhere for about 6 months or more. But I got over it. Cuban Pete's is not fine dinning and I should not judge it as such. I get the chicken lollipops to start and hubby gets the Miami salad. Both were pretty tasty. For my main meal, I get the skirt steak in the spicy sauce and hubby gets the oxtail. I did not enjoy the steak although the black rice it came with was delicious. The steak was chewy and not made to my specification. I assumed hubby's oxtail was bland since he had to douse it with salt and pepper. I was unable to confirm the blandness until later. It was so unbelievably loud in the place. Between the music and the obnoxious, no-manners having group behind us, conversation was not a possibility, unless we felt like yelling. Which we didn't. And not once did our waiter check on us to see if everything was ok. Not once. By the end of our meal, I could not wait to leave the place. I wanted to strangle the girls behind us, throw a wrench at whatever was playing the music, and snarl at the host for seating us in this stupid NIP section. Overall a bland experience. I'm just glad the price matched the quality. Not too say all low-priced restaurants have bland food (I've had some really god meals for a steal), but in this case it did. The End. Sike. I actually want to share a quick story to show how insensitive these people are. I am about to leave the bathroom, which was in the VIP section of the restaurant (us NIPs did not merit a bathroom in our section) when I see a MALE waiter holding the door open. Me and all the other women in there are looking at him like he lost his mind. How dare he??? He was harassing a woman that was washing her hands. He kept saying something to her (he clearly spoke no english) while furiously pointing at the sign on the door. He (and only him) assumed that the woman was a man. Short hair and loose clothing does not automatically mean "man". I knew that and so did the others in the bathroom. Awkward and so uncomfortable. If we were in NY the restaurant would've been slapped with a hefty fine. What he did is highly illegal. The End. For real this time.	2.0
Cuban Pete's has GREAT curb appeal and has intrigued the boyfriend and I every time we drove past it. For our first lunch in our new area of Caldwell / Montclair we just had to try it. And we were ready for a mid-day  Mojito! .... Crickets ... As New York natives we had NO IDEA of this BYOB at a lot of local restaurants. So we were VERY disappointed in that. But after talking to some other dinners who filled us in, it seems like this BYOB rule can save us some serious cash! We are on board for the idea now! The food at Cuban Pete's we great! Hands down the best Cuban sandwich I've had. The atmosphere is great! It's fun! Would LOVE to host an event here. We'll be back once we settle in!	4.0
Great food. The one problem: the music is WAY TOO LOUD.	4.0
A great unique place in Montclair, that is mostly full of overpriced Italian spots. This one stands out with its reasonable prices and huge portions, as well as the BYOB policy. They even make you a bunch of types of sangria if you bring the wine. Lots of choices on the menu for tapas type small dishes, as well as a good selection of entrees. All are done well and have very flavorful sides like coconut rice or plantains, etc. Lots of seating but does get pretty busy. In the summer they have an amazing patio as well.	4.0
The food was good, the atmosphere was great....the music was SO LOUD though we had to shout to each other at the table to try and hear each other.  It's definitely a fun place for a group of people and I'd love to go back in the summer to experience the outdoor seating.	4.0
This is an awesome place with a few minor flaws... First the uppity hostess girl that took us to our table. Not a fan at all. She saw us standing around looking for who was supposed to take us to our table and she let us stand there for a good 3 mins before she decided she would approach us. Then she proceeds to tell us that she is NOT a server or a waiter.... oh...ok :-/ Then they cram 6 of us into the tiny outside room with a bunch of other tables... and barely any walking room which required someone to get bumped every 2 mins as a waiter walked past. It was also pretty cold as the door kept getting opened and left open and the small heater they had in there was not working. Those were the only two complaints I had so lets get to the good stuff: Food - awesomeness. I had the Chicken Lollipops (they were good though nothing fantastically orgasmic) and the Bacalao (orgasmic...nuff said) tapas. My entree I had the Boliche (Cuban Pot roast stuffed with Chorizo) this was very delicious. It was slightly salty which worked well with the mound of plantains and white rice. I had enough to bring home to eat for lunch today. Everyone elses food was delicious. One friend had the paella, someone else had the steak. We also did the mango and apple sangria. I want to come back and try the banana sangria and maybe one of the mojitos. The outdoor seating looks like it is probably wonderful in the sping/early summer. We spent a lot of time taking pictures after we finished our dinner since there were plenty of props. Our server Hector was cute! and knowledgeable. We also enjoyed the birthday drums and singing. Can't wait to go back!	4.0
Ill keep it short and sweet on this one. Cuban Pete's is more of a nuevo latino spot than a pure cuban eatery. That being said, there is NO spot around, and I mean NO spot in the area that has a better outdoor atmosphere in the summer time. The menu is vast, some things are great, some things are just ok, but I have always been good with the food that I chose and never once have sent anything back. The owner (who I have known for many years) is the key to the vibe of this place. He is quick to give a firm handshake, hug and a kiss to the ladies making you feel like the most important people in the place. I recognize that Dom (owner) is a rather controversial character (and is an easy candidate for the "FUN TO WATCH LIST" if he gets too many wines in him); but he has always been great to us and has been the secret I feel to the success of all of his endeavors. Even before Cuban Pete's. The staff is fun and friendly as well. Regulars are always gifted with the occasional dessert on the house showing that they appreciate loyalty. I have had a number of birthdays here and everyone that I have taken has been happy and always comes back. Anything with shredded pork is awesome. The appetizers are almost always great. And I always dig the chicken cubano which is nice and garlicky. Rice and beans are solid too. This is one of those places that actually succeeds in making up for occasional culinary misses with great people and atmosphere. I think it should be studied by social scientists and used as a benchmark on how to WIN in the restaurant business. I don't drink so I cannot speak to the sangria. All i know is that it is low alcohol content and EVERYONE brings interesting stuff to pour into it themselves. Many dig this and partake often. Daddy Like	4.0
If this place was in NYC, it would be packed all the time. Its still packed even in Montclair. I was finally able to make it to this place after lots of locals recommended the restaurant.  Luckily we live 15 min away in Wayne. We tried 2 tapas dishes as appetizers: Pernil con Tostones - Shredded pork with slices of plantains.  The shredded pork is cooked again to give it a bit of jerky texture.  This is a really unique dish that I really enjoyed!   Al Ajillo - Shrimp in garlic sauce.  So damn good. I wish I had bread to dip it in the garlic sauce... As main dishes, we ordered: Suckling Pig - I freakin love pork.  They serve it with a black bean rice and a side of yuka.  The rice is awesome, I don't know how they cooked the yuka but its the tastiest yuka I have had and the pork was awesome too!  A bit minty and not alot of spices in it so that you can really taste the goodness of the pork. Ricky Ricardo's Ribs - If you are Korean, you know what a Kalbi Cheem is.  This was freaking awesome Kalbi Cheem served with black bean rice and yuka!  I loved this dish!  The meat was falling apart when you touch it with your fork.   This is definitely one of my favorite local restaurants!  The only reason it didn't get a 5 star was the service.  They serve alot of food.  My wife and I wanted it to be wrapped to go.  We asked the waiter if we can get it wrapped and he just handed us 2 containers and left... Alrighty then... We started packing the food by ourselves thinking WTF?  As this was our first time here, I will reserve judgment until my second time about service but making us wrap our own food was really a turn off.  But I cant blame the establishment for 1 jackass of a waiter. I will be back to eat some more awesome dishes!  And I will ask for it to get wrapped again!  We shall see what happens next time Cuban Pete!	4.0
Surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet. I actually have two different perspectives because I've been going for awhile (when I ate meat and now that I don't): When I DID eat meat, I found that it was really touch and go. Some things were perfect and amazing and others were bland and dry. I remember the chicken being terrible but the pork was cooked perfectly. You never really know. Now that I don't eat meat, I was really worried but I had the vegetarian paella and OH. MY. GOD. Really, though, all of the carnivores at the table were drooling over my dish. When I finally thought I'd share it, they wanted more and more. I think most liked my dish over theirs! And they were pretty happy with their orders! It was some mango lime paella and truly amazing. I've tried to replicate it, but can't. If nothing else, I've never, ever heard of or had one bad appetizer. Go and order a few small plates and bring a shit ton of booze and you'll be set! It's definitely worth it. On a warm summer night or, really, you can eat there whenever!	4.0
I work nearby so I usually end up going on weekdays at about 6pm. The portions are MUCH larger than they are after 7:30 pm or anytime on the weekend. Service depends on the crowd you bring. They are not too attentive if you are on date! I have dreams about the ropa vieja. BYOB is great too!	4.0
I've only had their tapas but everything I had was excellent. I especially recommend the "chicken lollipops" as the cilantro + lime combo is divine!! The entree portions I saw others eating looked very yummy but be warned: they're HUGE! You'll have two or three meals worth of food so plan accordingly. My final comment: get their sangria. It's fabulous, even if you drink it virgin. We had the asia de cuba. It was so delicious but we didn't realize it was BYOB or we would've had pure gold.	5.0
This place's main strength by far is ambience.  The entryway is through a path lined with palm trees -- it feels as though you're walking into another world right as you walk into the place.  The servers wear Panama hats, and the decorations inside of the place are also very fun.  In this sense, Cuban Pete's is top-notch for atmosphere. The food is quite good, too.  Everything is quite tasty, and I haven't gotten a single dish I've been unsatisfied with.  The mojitos are good, too (but don't expect to get drunk -- it's less than 1% alcohol). The downside is that it gets very crowded on Fridays and weekends, and they don't take reservations.  If you plan to go on one of these days, expect to wait a long time or go as early as possible.  Otherwise, going on an odd day during the week is your best bet in getting a table within a reasonable amount of time.	4.0
I base my review 90% on quality of food vs. overall experience. I visited Cuban Pete's last year and was not impressed being that I grew up on authentic Cuban food. I decided to give it a 2nd chance recently. Sadly, I was still not impressed. I ordered the Pollo Cubano and my boyfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja. Both dishes were not impressive at all to say the least. If you are interested in authethic Cuban food this is not the place. The atmosphere is fun and enjoyable. Besides the atmosphere I have nothing else positive to say.	2.0

After hearing/seeing mixed reviews from friends and online I finally tried out Cuban Pete's myself. I gave this restaurant a 3-star rating because the food and atmosphere were great but the service was horrendous. I felt like I was inconveniencing the person whose job it was to serve us. Went in for an early dinner (party of 2) so we were sat immediately. I was highly impressed with the decor and atmosphere, then our server arrived. No introduction, didn't give us his name, just proceeded to ask "what are we having". We ordered the Pineapple Mojito, Goat Cheese Fritters, and Chicken Empanadas to start. The drinks and the tapas came out fairly quickly and were delicious. Our server never returned to see if the food was satisfactory or if we needed anything else even though he had other tables directly next to us. Our entrees arrived which were the Lamb and Pepper stew and the Paella. Both were large portions and once again tasted delicious. Between the sweetness of the mojito and the savoriness of the stew I could really use a glass of water at that point. But once again our server was nowhere to be found. I'm not sure if I would ever go back but if I did it would only be for takeout.	3.0
Classy friendly  greeting at the door. Seated my friend and I 10 minutes before closing on a Friday night, with big smiles and open arms. LOVE IT!  I really appreciated that!  We were famished after a show at the Wellmont Theater. We were able to quickly order a pitcher of mojitos, tapas plates of empanadas  and clams, and the suckling pig dinner. The empanadas were light and crispy. The clams themselves were lacking meat, but the sauce was garlicky and wonderful. Suckling pig dish was a huge portion of properly cooked  pulled pork with an equally huge portion of rice, black beans and yucca adorned with mint leaves. My friend and I dug in until we were full. The pork was a little "gringo" for me, lacking a real Cuban flavor. We asked for some hot sauce and was given BBQ sauce (HA!), something like you would expect on a sweet BBQ sandwich ( we chuckled). Not what we expected, but we don't hold that against them. As it turned out the sauce on the clams was a perfect compliment to the pork and we proceeded to soak fork fulls of pork in it.  All said the atmosphere was party like, club music a little disturbing, but fun  service was great and the food decent. I took my pile of pork, rice and beans home and fed the entire family lunch the next day! Kudos to Cuban Pete's for getting us seated, fed and out the door in a town that was rolling up their sidewalks!	3.0
I used to LOVE this place and would bring many friends here. I started noticing that the cooks were using fish as a filler for the meat stews, or any dish where it could be hidden. It's hidden underneath really well. If you hate fish, you'll notice. Plus you can see the fibers are different. Also, they can't make rice to save their life. A true embarrassment to Cubans. Don't care for the 50 tons of salt in my food either. Last issue that is keeping me from ever going back- the part of the restaurant that is not attached. The area that you have to walk back outside to get to. Wonderful in the summer, horrible in colder weather when the servers want to seat you there and leave the doors open. Yes, they're scooting around. However, the patrons are there seated to enjoy a meal that they're paying for. I'd say my/our comfort is more of a priority. Boycotted. That is all.	2.0
Did not care for it.  Overrated and service subpar.  The manager is a true jackass.  Has absolutely no concept of customer service.	1.0
Mmmm, Cuban Pete's. Some advice: if you absolutely have to go here on a weekend, avoid the crowds by going for an early dinner. If you arrive there at 7 or 8, bring snacks and maybe a lawn chair to prepare for the wait (kidding about that last part, there's barely any space for people to wait, let alone a lawn chair). Also, bring some wine, rum, and/or whatever alcohol you want as this is a BYOB joint. They have different flavors of sangria and mojito mixes for you to add your liquor into. I love the churrasco and the super garlic-y lechon asado. Every time I go there, I tell myself I have to branch out and try something else, but I always end up ordering one of those. I also love the plantains each dish comes with. The rice and black bean sides are great too. If you're taking a date here for food and nice conversation, good luck having that conversation as it is really loud at peak dinner times and both of you will be too focused on eating your food and forget to talk. From the diners to the people waiting for tables to the salsa music to the staff to the birthday drums...it can feel a little crazy. It's an ideal place for groups because you don't have to worry about being the loudest people in the restaurant. Service has been consistently good. I love the waiters' hats and outfits. Occasionally I get a cute waiter which is always a plus. When it's warm (but not hot) out, I like sitting at the tables outside. The atmosphere and decor make me feel like I'm on vacation and not in the middle of downtown Montclair. Parking is available in the lots behind Cuban Pete's and on the street but it's definitely a bitch finding a spot when it comes to the weekend. Note that parking is metered until 7 pm Monday-Saturday.	4.0
Great atmosphere. Food was very good.	4.0
This is an extremely clean lively and well run establishment. The people here are always happy to see you. The service is ON POINT! The food is F&#$@NG AWESOME! Everytime! The vibe is fun. I save this place for special occasions, days where I need a pick me up, or meals in which I have to impress someone. You can't help but feel like you took a plane to get there and I just love it. In the musical chairs of Bloomfield Avenue businesses, this place is one of the few things that keep Montclair on the radar.	5.0
I feel like I need to give this place another try. However, the night I went it was so devastatingly loud I had to scream across the table to talk to my boyfriend. It seemed like Happy Birthday drums were being thumped every 10-15 minutes. The food was just not IT, and I was expecting more because I have had people recommend going here and tell me how much they loved this place. On a positive note, I loved the concept of various pitchers of juice mixtures and then pouring your own vodka or whatever into it. BYOB is always a plus!	3.0
This is one of those places that guarantee's atmosphere. Bring your own rum and order the watermelon mojito. Some people forget that it's Cuban food...expect your food to be fried.  It's good stuff.	4.0
Cuban Pete's is an anomaly for me insofar as I actually wish it were a chain. The food was amazing, the atmosphere holds the hard-to-perfect dynamic of a place that is both bustling with activity yet intimate. I've heard stories of long wait times, which is why I'd never been before, but we got right in. We ordered the chicharon de pollo (chicken 'lollipops') and empanadas for appetizers. For my meal, I ordered the churrasco (marinated skirt steak w/ spicy chimichurri sauce) that came with white rice, black beans, and plantains. I can honestly say that in all of my restaurant experiences, the quality of this dish far outweighed the price. They could easily be charging more for it. We shared a tres leches cake slice for dessert, and that's probably the only thing I didn't love as much as I wanted to. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing. The food was all prepared perfectly. No flavor overpowered another. Everything really played its role in what was hands down one of my best dining experiences of the year. I can't speak to authenticity, but when the food is this good? I don't care what they're branding it as. Just keep it coming.	4.0
I love this plc!  The food is amazing anf thr prices are fabulous!  The portions are big I alwys have left overs... the seating is bumper to bumper but its overall a vreat plc.  Byob there Sangrias are delicious bring a bottle of wine fo pour in. Appetizers are indxpensive and just the right size for one person.  If you dont wanna deal with noise or crowd go earlier in the day.  I see ppl bring kids here but I dont recommend it the space is too tight.	5.0
Although these guys are not you average Fork on the left, white napking 5 star Caucasian gourmet place. This place is there to have some fun while you eat and great people all around despite the fact that they are ALWAYS tremendously busy every time I go. I had my dessert messed up, I told our waiter and he told me to keep the one I had and gave me the correct one at no charge. The music is loud but great and makes you want to dance all you ate off. The portions are huge and that's exactly how it's supposed to be, not a 3oz steak with a leaf on top... forget that. This place is here to give great food, great music and have fun.	5.0
Last time we were here for dinner it was prior to a concert. We were expecting a leisurely dinner with time left over for a drink before. What we got was some seriously aggressive wait staff. I lived in Miami for 5 years and while I can't speak a lot of Spanish I know what food I like and how to order it without sounding like a stupid American. So when I ordered our apps, the server repeated everything back to us in perfect Spanish. Our apps came out fast. Then almost immediately followed by our dinners. Our server came by and offered to put our dinners back in the kitchen so we could enjoy our apps. Under the heat lamp for 20 minutes- no thanks. We kept our app plates and our dinners. His parting comment "everything looks amazing and delicious enjoy" While we ate our dinner and apps a bus person came over at least 5 times to clear our plates. To which we asked "please leave the plate." Then our server came over, asked how amazing our food was and attempted to take our plates away, again. At one point a bus person came over and took our plates and we just gave up and let them go. This was all in a span of 15 minutes mind you. Ordered coffee after dinner, again had our pronunciation corrected and offered delicious pastries and desserts. I've worked in the restaurant industry. As a server I made suggestions too, but not nearly as aggressively as this server. Not everything is delicious and amazing and wonderful, let me decide. They are a busy restaurant and need to turn tables, I get that. But don't have apps an dinner out within 2 minutes of each other. Don't have such aggressive wait staff and bus staff that the customers are bothered 5 times in 15 minutes to clear a plate that's being used. The food is pretty good. Some of it can be greasy. Goes with the territory of fried food. It's bring your own but the sangria mixer they sell seems to be a bit over priced.	3.0
Fun place great food!! Would be 5 stars but the hostess (with tattoos on her wrists and arms) was so incredibly rude-- she made us feel so uncomfortable-- like we were a huge inconvenience-- it was completely out of context. She is bad news for their business.  Other than that girl we would go back!	3.0
This place would be worth a couple extra stars if you didn't have to wait 3 hours for a friggin' table.  Maybe I'd give it a couple extra stars if I could go more frequently.  Points for BYOB, and the food is decent, but you're definitely paying for "the scene".  It's loud, the girls are dressed slutty, and the music is entertaining.  This place is fun for a night out with a group if you can actually get a table.  If you're looking for great Cuban food, there's a good place across the street in Montclair (I forget the name - I should probably review it), and Cubana Havana in Hackensack is excellent.	2.0
The atmosphere and the fact that its BYOB are awesome but food and service are not the best, not horrible but not good.	3.0
Awesome food, lively and vibrant atmosphere. Excellent Sat night dinner spot!!	4.0
Came early on a Friday night and had no problem with getting a seat. The decor and service was top notch and a very fun atmosphere. The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation but after a few glasses of Sangria, no problemo. So BYOB and try out one of their sangria mixes. Got the beef empanadas to start and they were tasty little morsels. For my entree I had the grilled skirt steak with the spicy chipotle chimichurri sauce and my friend had the arroz con pollo. First off, her plate was enormous and literally 3 servings. My steak was cooked perfectly and I loved the chimichurri sauce, wish they had put more on the plate. I will admit the yucca was very dry for my taste.  Anyways I was only able to eat half before having to loosen my belt and took the other half home. All in all, worth the money!	4.0
I purposely came on a weeknight after reading how crowded it gets on a weekend. It was still bustling but no wait. What can I say. I was swooned by Pete's decor, the service and the food, all at VERY fair prices considering what you're getting. Must go again!	5.0
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere of this restaurant. It makes me feel like I'm actually in cuba (although i wouldn't know because i've never been to cuba).   I don't think their tapas were that great but their entrees were amazing.   We had the skirt steak entree and it was one of the best steak i've ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and just melts in your mouth. We also had one of their whole fish plate with plantain and it was delicious. I'm actually craving it now as i'm typing this review. I would definitely go back to this restaurant the next time i'm in new jersey. There were four of us and our bill came out be less than $90 because the place is BYOB. Very cool.	4.0
This place has a nice atmosphere and the food is well prepared. I am sure it would be a great spot for a night out with friends. We went with our moms and our toddlers for lunch on a Saturday after a trip to the zoo. There was nothing wrong with it. It just didn't knock our socks off.  We were seated right away but otherwise the service was inattentive. The tostones con pernil tapa was the favorite but the other items we got were pretty ordinary. As far as being a good place to bring kids, I would say our children were tolerated, but it wasn't as welcoming as other places we have brought them.	3.0
One of the things I miss most about NJ... I thought I had already reviewed Cuban Pete's. We must have been going at odd times because I never encountered the dreaded wait time. Everything is delicious and served in a fun atmosphere, even the restrooms are decorated. The Ropa Viejo and Arroz con Pollo were the Go To's The Al Ajillo is great as a starter as is the Cuban sandwich. The coffee is good too! Great spot for amazing tasting food for lunch or dinner and family friendly. I'd highly recommend trying them and if you can't stand a wait go for lunch when they first open. Metered parking out front.	5.0
We waited 45 minutes on a Sunday night for a table, then it started raining and all the outside diners came running inside and took all the open tables, so we had to stand there and wait longer. When we finally got seated we all shared lots of appetizers, which were all very good.  We all shared the famous Sangria, which was Not good.  It just tasted like grape juice, and when we told the waiter what it tasted like, he replied "that's really what it is " because they do not have a liquor licence, and yet they claim to make famous Sangria?!?? For dinner I had the Churasco Steak which was the very Best I've ever tasted.  It was delicious and I do look forward to going back for this Churasco, (not the sangria).  The service was good, as they are so overstaffed with so many people running around, back & forth, so much, it almost looked chaotic, but they got the job done.  This place is very LOUD as all the noise bounces off all the walls so much that you can't hear the people talking at your own table.  To have a conversation, you have to yell at the people at your own table.	3.0
Went here a couple of weeks ago with the family for my husband's birthday lunch. We made a reservation since we had six people, but it turned out not to be necessary. I also asked the hostess if we could bring in a cake and she said it was no problem.We've always gone in the evenings before and encountered a wait of at least 20 minutes, but lunch is a whole different experience. Our waiter was very attentive and absolutely adorable! I let him know upon our arrival that it was Hubby's birthday and he promptly took the cake in the back and brought us pitchers of water for the table. He suggested a few appetizers and a pitcher of mojitos (no alcohol since some of us had to go back to work) and described various dishes for the couple of people who hadn't been there before. The table shared the spinach & cheese empanadas and the beef empanadas. I had the pollo cubano, grilled chicken breast with a garlic mojo and ice and black beans. The chicken was yummy! It was a little crunchy on the outside, but still cut easily. Hubby had the churrasco steak and while it wasn't "spicy" to him, he said it had wonderful flavor and was cooked to perfection. Others ordered the arroz con pollo, the oxtails, the paella and the ribs. Rice and beans were brought for the entire table. One person was shocked by the portion of arroz con pollo. He barely made a dent in it at the restaurant, but told us he enjoyed it for dinner that night and again for lunch the next day. Everyone was pleased with their meals and all of the dishes came out together, which sometimes doesn't happen with a larger party. After we finished our entrees, our waiter brought out the cake to the rhythm of several drums, maracas and a metal block with a stick. They sang something to Hubby in Spanish and everyone clapped along and did a bit of chair dancing. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly and we actually went back for lunch yesterday and ate on the patio. Same great, fast service and more delicious food. I only gave it 4 stars because parking can be quite a challenge at times, but definitely worth it. We'll be adding Cuban Pete's to our regular rotation!	4.0
So let me start by saying, this wasn't my first pick of places to dine. I am not a fan of plantains and I thought I hated yucca. BUT the restaurant we were headed to was closed on Monday and we ended up here. I couldn't have been more impressed. So we were told it was BYOB, and I didn't quite get it because it said that they served sangria. But then it was explained that they serve punch mixes that you can bring wine to add to and make Sangria! SUCH A GREAT IDEA! Tip: There is a wine store two doors down from the restaurant in case you forget to bring one. We had the Goat Cheese appetizer and the Empanadas and both were delish. Both of our dinner portions were HUGE and we have a crazy amount of leftovers. I was also very impressed with the food preparation. I have had yucca several times before and have never liked it. Last night, I have no idea what they did to prepare it(i believe it was simply roasted) but it was to die for! This restaurant is very large, you have to walk through a jungle lined pathway to get in and we saw four large rooms and a spacious outdoor forum and all were full of people. The only reason this place doesn't get five star is that it is the LOUDEST place I have ever been to. They were pumping in music overhead and we couldn't hear anything we were saying. We were also sat by several groups that had birthdays and drums were brought in, I believe there was a cowbell and I had to plug my ears!	4.0
We stop there for late lunch on Sunday. Foods were good as always. Red sangria was good to. The service is a different story. Many waiters running back and forth but there is nobody to take the order. That is not the first time but the food is worth the wait.	4.0
Honestly I don't understand the high reviews this place has. I have tried several Cuban restaurants better than this...food was ok, nothing special. Music was really loud and the place didn't seem really clean.	3.0
This review is long overdue.....I have been to Cuban Petes on 3 separate occassions, the first time by choice the 2 remaining times at the request of friends. Food I've had much better cuban food. The first two times eating here I was so underwhelmed it was just blah. I come from a Latin background and this just wasnt the same as what Im use to. The last occassion here I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the apps as well as my meal (pernil) Could this have been a fluke? Who knows but I wont be coming back to figure it out. Staff I wouldnt use pleasant to describe the waitstaff, they are more on the brusque side. No pleasantries, a lot of rushing you and poor followup on all 3 of my visits. I understand your busy and turning your tables is part of the job but you arent giving the people who are out to enjoy a nice dinner out any reason to want to tip you well. You get back what you put out. Ambiance Cuban Petes decor is just lovely,  all the different dining areas are decorated so nice and the cute little outdoor area is my favorite, its almost like your in another world. Petes Im not sure if you are aware noise level factors into your ambiance. Each and every time Ive visited I think I lost just a bit of my hearing. Can you turn DOWN the SPEAKERS just a few decibles please!!! I think my party and I said "What" more times in one sitting than I care to count. Now I love the live musicians you have going on as well that makes it fun and its great to see and hear something different every now and again. That being said you might want to consider either moving where these musicians play or having them play for shorter periods b/c again the noise level is way to high to enjoy your meal. Oh Petes I had such high expectations of you after hearing so many wonderful things but you have fallen short on to many levels for my liking. All I can say is....Adios....	2.0
LOVE THIS PLACE!! Have never been disappointed at Cuban Pete's. Service is friendly (albeit you will wait for a table on weekends.. my suggestion? BYOB and start it while you wait ;-)) Food is more than generous and reasonable. Ambience is super cute and festive. Some nights they have traditional live music playing and really gives off a great vibe. If there is an hour wait..there is a good reason! Pulled steak and rice and beans is great. Ah everything is good. Go here ASAP	5.0
SOOO crowded, but the food is SOOO tasty! Don't bother coming at prime time on a Friday or Saturday (they don't take reservations). But if you can get there early, you can get seated rather quickly, and on a nice day, the outdoor seating is awesome! Food is great, sangria mix is yummy! BYOB	3.0
This place is absolutely wonderful. Definitely BYOB or you're missing out on all the fun. I would recommend bringing moscato and getting the sangria with strawberries, oranges, peaches, and coconut. This place is my favorite Cuban restaurant ever! For the meal, order the oxtail- it's very good. Also order the seafood paella too!! Both were very filling!	5.0
I absolutely love this place. It's got amazing food, even better drinks and a wonderful atmosphere. Never have I had a waiter anything less than perfect. Even if you've never tried Cuban food, this place will not intimidate you and has something for everyone. Oh, and their coconut rice is to die for.	5.0
First time at Cuban Pete's last night, and I am a fan!  It may not be for everyone and I certainly understand some of the complaints in the previous reviews but if you are looking for a good time, as in a loud and fun party, Cuban Pete's is the place.  It's just what I needed as I am dreading the end of summer so the Sunday night of Labor Day weekend I met a friend there for dinner.  Loud music - YES!  Colorful crowd - YES!  Authentic Cuban menu - YES!  With the palm trees, music and Latin languages heard from the other tables, it really felt like Havana.  The downside is you need to be in the mood for this type of place.  Looking for a quiet, romantic place, this is not it, except maybe in the middle of January.  The outdoor patio was packed and barely room for the wait staff to move. That said, the service is very slow.  We were in no rush and actually enjoyed being able to sit there for a few hours.  Our waiter came back twice to take our order and on the third time, we were ready.  We ordered the Manchego cheese and spinach empanadas which were fabulous.  The dough on the empanada wasn't greasy and was flaky and tender.  The sauteed shrimp with double garlic was also terrific but it almost burned with the amount of garlic.  Be aware - if you like that kind of intense garlic flavor I would definitely go for it. The 2 different ribs we each ordered were good with a complex flavor profile that I couldn't begin to describe.  The downside was the amount of fat left on the ribs, probably for basting and tenderness.  I know it wasn't a low cal meal!  The sides were variations on beans and rice and the cooked yucca was delicious.  Somehow the outside was slightly crisp and the inside tender and flavorful; I had never had yucca before.  The portions were huge so we each brought home a doggy bag with equally as much food as we ate. It's BYOB so lots of people brought wine and made sangria with the many options the restaurant offers. The crowd seemed to arrive right after 6 pm and continue through 9 pm so I would get there early if you want a table.  Large parties were the norm and birthdays the primary celebration. Be aware the birthdays are celebrated by the wait staff with loud drums banging and singing.  Not subtle and definitely not quiet.  But if you're in a party mood like I was last night, it's all part of the welcome atmosphere.  I will definitely be back.	4.0
So I've been here twice and both times didn't really like it. I gave it three stars because there's nothing really wrong with the food (although it is on the salty side) but its atmosphere isn't for me. It's super loud so if u want a place where u want to have a conversation this isn't the place. Also on the weekend it very crowded so I suggest you get there early in order to get a table at a decent time. I saw people bring their own wine so I'm assuming this place is BYOB. The apps were good, we had the goat cheese with walnuts, cheese empanadas and the garlic shrimp. For dinner I had the coconut shrimp and my fiancé had the skirt steak with spicy chimichurri sauce. The food was average and The service was fast. I just wasn't feeling the atmosphere at all. But every weekend this place is packed!!	3.0
I thoroughly enjoyed the autheticity of this restaurant.  They really try to hard to make your dining experience excellent.  They have things that no other restaurant has, such as kegs of sangria and trees to make you feel like you are in cuba.  I cannot comment on their meat selection, because I do not eat meat, but apparently they have all of that down pat.  The one and only gripe that I have with them is that their indoor dining area has a dirty wet mop stinch.  That is a big no-no in the restaurant industry.	4.0
5 stars--first time trying cuban food, and it was delicious! I had the vegetarian entree, but I also got to try the steak, fried whole chicken, and mango chicken from my family and it was all great! We got the family style appetizers, with gives you bigger portions, but still gives you the chance to try more than one item. I would recommend not going on a weekend for dinner for the first time because it is crazy crowded!! I did not enjoy how it was crowded when I went, but I still loved the food. My whole group kept saying how we would want to come back on a week day or for lunch. (I have passed Cuban Petes several times during these times and it doesnt look too crowded.	5.0
Best Cuban food in the area. If you complain about the wait.....that's your fault for not checking before hand. If you can write a review online you can check their website and call as well. No liquor license....but bring a bottle of wine for sangria!	4.0
If your trying to get in from the Bloomfield Avenue entrance, you will find yourself walking through the restaurant and shimming through people's tables. It's ridiculous. They need to organize it better. Also, be prepared to wait....a while. The food is good but it feels so overcrowded. Your allowed to bring your own liquor but it would be easier if they paid for a dam license and served sangria or some Cuban drinks.	2.0
A few things you need to know before going: 1) More often than not, you'll be waiting a long time for a table...but it's well worth it! 2) BYOB!! 3) You have to order your apps and entree all at once so be prepared! I absolutely LOVE Cuban Pete's! The decor is great and makes you feel like you're on an island instead of in the middle of Jersey.  Yes, there are many tables and sometimes it feels like you're too close for comfort, but with great food, just the right music, and yummy sangria, who really cares?!  If you're looking for a fun night out for dinner, look no further! The service is good and the owner is a nice guy.  Don't get on his bad side though...I've seen him turn away customers for being outright rude!! My favorite dishes: Pernil con Tostones and Rabo Encendido	4.0
To me going out to eat and having a good time is made up of two key aspects; most important is the food obviously. But also the look & feel of the place can add to the pleasure of a meal. Cuban Pete's is a classic case of the good, the bad and the ugly. To be fair if you like Spanish food like Cuban cuisine then you can't go wrong at Pete's. The food was delicious. Everything we had, from the appetizer to the main course to the dessert was delicious. Hell even the coffee was great! The décor is also nice. The place gives you the feel like you're at some sugar plantation. Even the waiters have the look with their traditional Cuban shirts and hats. Food & décor wise Cuban Pete's is a homerun. Now the bad.....The wait to get into this place was nuts. This is a large place with multiple dining salons and outdoor seating as well. Yet it was mobbed. And with so many people waiting for a table and no place to sit you better wear some comfy shoes. We were herded into a "waiting" room to wait to be called. A few times I just felt like saying the hell with it lets go but figured I'd waited this long. We waited like an hour and a half for a table. And to make matters worse and what I believe adds to the terrible wait is that Cuban Pete's is a BYOB place. So people, when they finally do get a table, are in no rush to leave. Especially when they have a few bottles of wine which Pete's is more than happy to sell you some Sangria mix for. We say plenty of people that had been finished eating for quite some time just sitting there milking their drinks. Not cool! And then the ugly. The place is pretty big and seats quite a lot of people yet it was incredibly tight and mobbed in there. They tried to squeeze too many tables into the place and that made it uncomfortable. I literally felt like I was dining with people on top of me and they were as the waiter was all over me every time he tried to squeeze by the 8 inches between my table and the one next to me. I was so close to the table next to me I could order off their menu!!! And worst of all....the sound. I thought I was at a rock concert! It w me and my wife at a table for two and we were less than 2 feet away from each other and couldn't hear what the other person was saying. We were literally screaming at each other!!! I don't know about you but I prefer not having to scream my dinner conversation. It got to the point when my wife and I just stopped talking and we ate the rest of our meals without saying a word. Why bother if the other person can't hear you anyway. If you're looking for a romantic dinner place to try and impress that special lady then this is not the place for that. Again to be fair the food at this place was excellent. But the food, although the most important part of an evening out, isn't the only thing to consider. If you don't mind waiting for hours to be seated and don't mind being squeezed to death and screaming at the top of your lungs to the person sitting right in front of you then you should be fine. Food = 5 stars Everything else = 1 star	3.0
Amazing! I have never walked away unhappy. The atmosphere is perfect and different, excellent for a summer night. There is usually a long wait but it's always worth it. The portions are HUGE, you definitely get a lot for your money	5.0
I remember me and my girl went here on a wednesday evening, and the wait made it feel like it was a saturday night boy! but it's all good, never fear Alexa is here **cue the corny superhero music** so instead of waiting in the restaurant we headed outside onto bloomfield ave, where there are a ton of stores. we walked the strip, ended up stopping at a liquor store, after all it is BYOB and i hear their sangria is good ;) we even got a discount from the liquor store because we were eating at a restaurant in the area! finally we're called to sit, they sit us in a comfy room. though it was packed we were able to order our meal and have it delivered to us in a reasonable time frame. we ate, we drank, we had a great time. staff was courteous and friendly	5.0
Living in Montclair, I've been to Cuban Petes over 30x throughout the past 5 years.  Their food has been Excellent whether you dine in our takeout.  My guests and I have NEVER EVER been disappointed with the food.  Ever.   My favorites: Mambo Kings Steak (YUM), Paella, Goat Cheese Fritters!! Service: Severe attitude from the hostess everytime it never fails.  The full male waitstaff, always pleasant and fast. **Pros - EXCELLENT food.  Cuban themed from the decor, music, wait staff uniforms, plate presentation, everything! **Cons - VERY LOUD.....its unbearable.  Mediocre service. Best Cuban Food in the tri-state area...hands down.  I only deal with the below average service b/c of the food.	4.0
Oh boy - Cuban Pete's you've got me torn.  I want to love you so bad but I can only like you... Cuban Petes is in a great little area, there are so many lil things to explore around it so I was excited to just be in the neighborhood.  We walked down a little path to get to the outside seating which was Sooooo cute (enter squeal) the outside seating is just precious but on a Monday night was packed solid.  We were seated inside, the decor and lighting was perfect and with the drums, cowbell and guido playing in the background I felt like I was going to have a real cuban experience. DRINKS: We brought a bottle of wine for Sangria and a botlle of Ciroc Coco as suggested by another Yelper.  We ordered the Asia de Cuba Sangria (Yum-O) and the Pineapple Mojito (5 Stars) the small pitcher is a little over half of the large we could have ordered small and small and had more than enough. Small pitcher 12.95 - Big pitcher 14.95 FOOD: Ughhhh! this is where things went Oh...So...Wrong.  First off after 5 you have to put your whole order in at once which sent us scrambling to figure out what we wanted to eat.  We ordered: Chicken Lollipops - Bah! overcooked and underwhelming, just dissapointing. Masitas Cerdo - Very good - juicy and well seasoned. Plaintain Rellena - sweet plaintain stuffed with meat really good I enjoyed these lots. Albondigas - These meatballs were so dry that my roomie and I were fighting over sauce when we told the server the meatballs are redic can we get more sauce he cae back and said the kitchen wouldnt give anymore sauce so we sent the meatballs back. Pernil - The pernil with tostones had potential but it was like room temp - so it wasnt as enjoyable. Entree Pargo Frito - Whole Fried Fish UGHHHHHHHH! just dissapointing because it came out at the same time as our food so it ended up getting cold and there were a lot of bones and no meat.  The rice tasted like dishwater - Im just sayin' So the food ruined my buzz from the great drinks - we had to gobble down our apps so that the entree would be hot still - and no luck. DESSERT: My roomie ordered something, I couldnt hear over the birthday boo-ya behind me (im not complaining about that - I love loud and rowdy) but the server came back and they were out of it, so we had no dessert. SERVICE: Service was great - I really liked our guy, I flet like he could have checked on us a bit more, he asked how the food was and my sangria kicked in and I was like "really dry" eeeeek! Im such a jerk. He took it well and was like we welcome feedback, yada yada yada.  Our bill was 60something for all that so it would have been a good deal if the food was better. To wrap it up - would I come back for dinner - No.  Would I come back for tapas and drinks and then go somewhere else for dinner - Yeah. Hope this helps.	3.0
Obnoxious patterns and okay food.  I've had better Cuban food in Ireland.  It's in the trendy area of Montclair so it has that going for it, but the food is overpriced for what you get.  Also, the wait staff sort of suck.  They have that upper Montclair snob attitude to them.  If you've never had Cuban food, don't go here and ruin a delicious cuisine.	3.0
I must be getting old but this place is loud. I would not recommend this place if it's a serious date night. But, this place is very popular. Forgot the name of it but the stew short ribs is great. My Gf's steak was really good too. Most of the tapas/appetizers are fried. Every thing is heavily salted. I'm not used to having my white rice seasoned. Be prepared for a long wait on weekends.	3.0
Great food and atmosphere. Pros are the food,amazing sangria mixes all you have to do is bring the wine. They also have mojito mixes which I have to try next. Only con is the wait took an hour to be seated we were a group of 4. But the wait is worth it I recommend the Ropa  vieja as main dish it was really really good yummmmm:)	4.0
This restaurant has done an incredible job with its decor. I've never been to Cuba, but from the tall shrubs along the long wooden walkway entrance to the wait staff in straw-looking fedoras to the wooden furniture, I felt like I stepped onto a Caribbean island. I came here for Sunday lunch so there was no wait but there was still a fair amount of people. The place is huge so I won't nitpick on the disorganized hostess and intermittent service. (I've never seen so many wait staff EVER & with all of them wearing the same outfit, so confusing.). But our server, Chris, was great - polite, patient, and knowledgable - even checked in with us a couple times. When I started to pour more sangria into our glasses, he happened to pass by (& probs thought I was struggling, which I was bc I have no upper body strength lol) & actually refilled our glasses himself... how thoughtful! The food here is above average, there's def better places for Cuban. We ordered 3 Tapas + 1 entree: Pernil Con Tostones (crispy pork with fried plantains & garlic mojo) - dry, flavorless, least favorite Costillas (crispy ribtips with mint chimichurri) - delicious! couldn't taste the mint but the chimchurri was pleasantly complex "Albondigas" (meatballs of beef, pork in manchego cheese) - MY FAVE! I don't usually like meatballs but this was well-spiced, and buffered by the cheese. Rabo Encendido (Braised oxtail in spicy tomato broth) - Great! Oxtail was very tender and the broth was only subtly spicy. Also came with rice (yum) and beans (the usual). We also got the Asia de Cuba White Sangria with sugarcane, ginger, mango, apples, & citrus fruit which was hands down, one of THE BEST I've ever had. It's pretty sweet but the sugarcane was perfect bc it wasn't overpowering. The ginger was undetectable (sadly) & some of the mangos weren't ripe, but overall delish. & with only 0.5% alcohol, it tasted like juice, but I still liked it!! (& that's saying a lot) Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking elderly people or those sensitive to noise. As the other reviews stated, the birthday drums are truly quite loud. But it's a fun, (poppin') casual place to wow out-of-towners (or locals), especially if you're willing to wait at night. 3.5 stars, rounding up for decor/ambiance and Chris, our awesome server.	4.0
Worst food..worst staff..overpriced crap	1.0
Flounder was OUTSTANDING.  Suckling pig flavorful but a bit dry on lean parts. Yams and yuca prepared to PERFECTION.  Coconut rice and rice and beans were awesome.  Service mediocre. The place is always busy & a bit understaffed, but that doesn't keep me away!	4.0
I went there for my birthday and it was simply just a great experience. Starting with the owner, who was so gracious and friendly and generous, he made sure that we were always pleased. To the food, it was delicious and authentically Cuban. Yes, it was a little loud and crowded, but after all, that's what Latins love. I would definitely reccomend it and pass the word on to my friends. I will be there again. Sincerely, Cristina from Argentina	5.0
I don't often write reviews unless the food/service is horrible or great! I have eaten at Cuban Pete's at least 20 times and have brought co-workers and Family a number of times, we all loved this place! I grew up in Jackson Heights in the 60's where we had a huge influx of great Cuban restaurants, and I had a ton of Cuban friends that their Mom's were terrific cooks, I have been to Victor's in the City many times, have been to Little Havana in Miami- So game over- Cuban Pete's tops them all!! And pricing....the best bang for the buck meal!! Service is fantastic!!! I have yet to have a bad service experience!! The owner is a real character! He is usually around asking how your meal is!! Again- if you are in NYC- it is well worth the trip! you will be totally ruined on Cuban food! The decor really brings me back to Little Havana in Miami in the late 60's!! What I can say is this, if you do not really know authentic Cuban fare and what it is suppose to taste like, than this type of cuisine might not be for you! If you know what real cuban food is than this is on par with the best! Their Lechon Asado (Cuban Roasted Pork) is just fantastic!	5.0
Dined at Cuban Pete's last week, just before going to a concert at the Wellmont Theater. We were lucky to snag a parking spot on the street out front.  The place was packed, as i'm sure it usually is.  The restaurant takes up several store fronts but also has a courtyard area that connects them and helps to add to the vibe of the place.  Really interesting decor - great paintings with bamboo frames, plants, bright colors, music coming from every angle, etc.  In the back there is a room that has huge jars of sangria in a variety of colors and flavors.   It seemed like there were hundreds of people waiting for tables and I was a little worried and claustrophobic.  Maybe because we were a party of 2 we were able to sneak in between bigger groups?  They said the wait would be about 45 minutes and I think we were seated in about 10 minutes.  I loved that this place attracted people of all shapes, sizes, and colors.  Some were in large groups, others just maybe on a date.  It seemed like the place to be and also seemed like very few of the patrons were headed to the Wellmont like we were. We ordered Sangria (Limonada Espana with Lemons and Peaches) - when it arrived the server told us it was what we ordered but they were out of lemons and peaches?  We tried it - it was terrible - and we asked for the Asia de Cuba instead (Sugarcane, Ginger, Mango, Apples, and Citrus)  ---- It was delicious, even without alcohol! The tapas was divine - bacon wrapped dates were by far the favorite, followed by chicken lollipops and  beef hash with plantains.  The plantains were super dry and hard.  Entrees were Ropa Vieja and a coconut shrimp dish.  Both were so so, the shrimp was rubbery - didn't seem fresh or home made. The coconut rice was uneven.  Some bites were delicious while others just tasted like minute rice. It is a toss up for the rating here - it wasn't a bad experience but I've had better.  If you're simply in it for the experience or to visit a place that makes you feel tropical, I'm sure you'll love Cuban Pete's.  In my opinion Cuban Pete's has missed a golden opportunity to wow people with the flavors of Cuba.  This seemed more like a Cuban themed Applebee's.	2.0
I've been here at least a dozen times and it's pretty consistent. The suckling pig is my usual choice. The pulled pork is always nice and tender and the yuccas are great. The sweet plantains are also excellent. At one point they were calling the wine mixers "sangria" even though they're not allowed to serve alcohol. I believe this has since changed but most of those options are good regardless. Overall  the menu is very affordable but the service is sometimes slow and the wait can be very long.	3.0
Food here is absolutely AMAZING! I tried the carne con papas (5 star), ceviche (3.5-4 stars), chicken lollipops (4 stars) and a clam tapa (3 stars). The wait can get very crazy so I would get there earlier to avoid the crowd, but it's definitely worth the wait! Some downside to the restaurant is extremely small tapas serving size, super busy waiters and extremely loud/crowded environment.	4.0
I had heard rave reviews from my co-workers and thought great Cuban food and Sangria was the way to go. Atmosphere was wonderful... until we were sat in an uneven corner on the outside patio. We went on a weekday and the place was not busy at all. Later on a couple was also sat right next to our table. I understand rotating sections, but really ? This place is large but seating is cramped. Our server was not very attentive, but an older server seemed to also keep an eye on us. Not the best service I've had. Tapas were delicious. Our entrees were plentiful ! I think one entree could actually be shared between 2-3 people. We ordered Cuban Pete Sangria which was bland and watered down.  For dessert we had the tres leches cake and at the mango flan. Mango flan tasted like it had traces of mango in it, otherwise, bland. The tres leches cake was awful; it tasted like cake just soaked in regular milk. In essence, I'm giving this place 3 stars for atmosphere and appetizers.	3.0
I will preface this review by telling you to get an early start when you're heading out to Cuban Pete's...because otherwise, you're going to wait a loooong time in cramped quarters! One could look at this as a burden and abandon all interest, but I challenge you to venture out (and bring your own alcohol as it's BYOB but they do offer virgin sangria) and see for yourself. It's a tropical escape once you meander down the path of overarching palms that line the entrance to the outdoor area. Mini waterfalls and festive latin music immediately entrance guests and makes it tough to leave if the wait is imposed on you. Waiters are dressed in classic Cuban casual attire and the vibe in general is very laid back (sometimes good, sometimes bad). I enjoy the menu because it contains an eclectic mix of Caribbean classics and reboots. It's not that authentic but I think the atmosphere combined with the scarce selection of latin food (Mexican does not count) makes this a local Montclair hot spot. Try it!	4.0
Incredibly loud and always busy! We went on a Monday and it was still very busy. Cuban is BYOB, and you can bring in your own wine that they turn into sangria for you. Pitchers of the mix will still cost you about $15, but they're really good and full of fruit. The service is less than desirable and everything is rushed. We tried putting in an appetizer order first, but for WHATEVER reason, they need the entire table to order everything all at the same time. Why? Because it's less work? We wanted to order tapas before our dinner, and the waiter assured us we'd have enough time to enjoy the tapas before the entrees came. We didn't. Entrees came out minutes after ordering a table full of tapas, we hadn't even finished any of them. That is so annoying, and awful service. The tapas are however really good. Goat Cheese Fritters are fried nicely and the honey vinaigrette is sweet but not overpowering. Empanadas are great. The chorizo is incredible and flavored with red wine. Bacon wrapped dates are one of my favorite things, and CP does it well. I feel like we should have just got a bunch of tapas! For dinner I had the short ribs. They were very tender and very good. All of the entrees at the table were enjoyed. If only the service was better!	3.0
Best Cuban food in new jersey Great atmosphere (a little loud) people are great. Dominic the owner is great. Always there remember everyone. Keep coming back for good Cuban food!	5.0
It's been a while since my last review but I'm trying to get back in the game and this is a great place to start. First, the place is deceiving from the outside, it seems awfully small. But inside it just opens up into this gorgeous courtyard, packed on a Wednesday night. I've never been to Havana but I lived in south Florida for a few years and this def to me back. So we get to our table and Pete's is a byob but they do serve some drinks. We decided to save the bottle of pinot noir (which we bought at the wine cellar next door and got a discount bc we.mentioned wed be dining at Cuban petes.) For later. So we ordered a pitcher of mango Mohito for like $15. Not a bad deal even if it was a little watered down. Tasted awesome. For apps we ordered from the tapas menu. Both were very good, the fried goat cheese with almond and the bolinho de bacalao. Fried salted cod, delicious, maybe not as good as the ones I had at paladar, but since she unfortunately closed these would have to do. There are allot of good choices on the menu, my date got the paella which would've been my first choice Lolol. So I opted for my good ol' stand-by, ropa vieja. One of my all time favorite dishes. It was def good and for the price, u can't beat it. Props to my girlo for the suggestion. Def goin back to Cuban Pete's for more! Provecho!	4.0
We came here with a group of people on 6/2.  Our reservation was for 6 pm and we would not be seated until everyone was there despite asking multiple times to be seated...so we stood for an hour and a half!  There were already 7 people there and still they would not give us a table. When we finally got seated the food was mediocre at best and definitely not worth the hype.  There are just no cuban places around the areas which is why this restaurant gets so packed.  I've had better Cuban food in Union City and the surrounding area.	1.0
This place was highly recommeneded by a good friend. So we all made a trip there, was about a good 40 min from NYC. They did not take reservations during the weekend apparently, so about 730p on a Saturday equals a potential 90 min wait for our group of 6. We walked around outside for about half hour since it was nice day, make sure you have your whole group by time your name is called btw. Once finally seated, we ordered appetizers, dates with bacon was amazing. Got a pitcher of red and white juice, we brouight our own bottles of wine, no corkage fee and they even opened it for us, That was a very nice touch. Our entrees were very delicious, speaking for the paella and chiaroscuro steak was so tender, the coconut rice was kind of bland tho, barely had any coconut flavor. This is a lively restaurant, AKA the occasional loud banging of drums to startle us for when peopel had birthdays, music was also blasting. I'd have given the food and especially the prices a solid 4 stars, maybe even 4.5 because you can bring your own bottles for the fruit punches, unfortunately the loud music, long wait, and spotty service brought them down to about an average expericence on a busy saturday night. Perhaps theyre much better on off nights like wed afternoon, business is good for them with all the people, but they need to be careful that they keep the wait shorter or more bearable somehow or they will lose first timers becoming potential regulars.	3.0
Tasty food, lively atmosphere, great service. I felt like I was on vacation when I went to eat here. The food was pretty good. I brought a pint of rum and ordered a pitcher of pineapple mojito with my girlfriend. We had an amazing time and are definitely going to come back. I would recommend coming here on a nice summer night and sitting outside.	4.0
I tried it again at the pleading of a friend. Wait time on a Friday: 75+ minutes and they kept "forgetting about us". The hostesses kept looking right at us. We checked in FIVE times and they said "you're next". One girl said " we never had you on the list. When did you get here?" Then the owner kept saying "don't worry ladies - soon!" This translates to "if you don't know the owner personally, appear on any reality show based in NJ, wear glitter, have chest hair or black slicked back hair and wear enormous gold chains (circa 1993) then you will be pushed back on the list until they can no longer avoid you." I am now convinced this is just a rouse and we were secretly being filmed for an episode of "Boiling Point" OMG: Those drums! THEY ARE HORRIBLE! Fun at first, but about 30 minutes into your experience you will reach your bongo-limit because every time you are right in the middle of your conversation, the jolting bongo-banging and shouting start up again. It becomes so overwhelming that leaping threw the plate glass window onto Bloomfield Avenue with moving traffic to escape seems like a completely logical idea. Food: expect 1-2 stars and you will be happy. Expect edible and/or 3+ stars and you're at the wrong place. Service: So bad you won't even know they employ living servers and hostesses. They do, however, employ several bongo-banging experts.	2.0
I always look forward to eating here. The food is amazing and the seating is nice too. Has a great cuban vibe to it and you feel like you are in country. One of my favorite locations to eat in North Jersey	5.0
Can't say enough good things about Cuban Pete's! I have been here a handful of times each time a great experience. Food is all great weather I've gone just for their delicious selections of apps. And a pitcher of sangria (byob) to mix in. Or if I have a full dinner the food and service is 5 star. Love Cuban Pete's	5.0
Another hyped up place, like Raymond's, that I'm not super impressed by. If it wasn't for the fun people I went with, I would give 1 star. Went on a gorgeous Thursday night, so it was packed and there outdoor patio is really nice, I'll give them that. We waited for about 20 min for a table outside...not bad. The waitor was nice..that's about it. It took over 1 HOUR to get our food and when we did, they were ALL wrong in some way. He was apologetic, but then took forever to get us our bill too. The food and sangria was average at best. I requested to have a side salad or side of veggies, but the waitor said they don't have any vegetables; that's a first for a restaurant. Obviously they don't cater to their customers. My fish was wayyy too salty, to the point that I had to scrap the crust off before eating it. The beans were bland and the yuca was oily and not peeled correctly. I tasted the steak and that was much better. Not a place for vegetarians or pescatarians, Fyi. Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.	2.0
Delicious food, tremendous atmosphere. I'll leave it to the other reviewers to expound on these qualities. However, I have to rate it as just an average place after visiting on Thursday night with a party of 7. We were seated promptly at 6:30 (we had made reservations) and by 7:00 the place felt insanely busy. Every inch of the huge restaurant is packed with tables and chairs. It was a little stressful trying to weave through the crowd to get to the bathrooms. Our waiter was scrambling the entire time we were there - though he apologized profusely and attended to everything that we asked, I felt a little guilty as I watched him scramble to cover his section. Fortunately, we were a large party with an event to celebrate so the noise level or speed of service weren't too important; it would've been too uncomfortable if it was a date, business, or family dinner.	3.0
COuldn't have asked for a better place to ring in my birthday!!  Was not expecting this place to be so busy on a weekday evening but thanks to my tiny tot in hand we were given a table right away.  The ambience is very interesting...the music LOUD (you really have to talk aloud to be heard over the din)...the servers enthusiastic  & the food's delectable.  ALl in all a very fun experience.	4.0
An out-of-town friend was visiting and decided she wanted to go here on recommendation from another friend of hers. While walking in, we felt like we had been transported, if not to a tropical island, at least on vacation. We reserved a table for ten and showed up on time and were seated promptly... and we waited... and waited... and waited... Until someone finally flagged down a passing server. He apologized and got our server and the manager. The manager apologized profusely, said it was his second week as a manager and gave us three complementary pitchers of sangria. The service was a little slow, but the place was pretty packed. My side came with avocado - which I'm intolerant to, and they took it away real quick to make a new dish - with apologies. The food itself was fantastic! I had a salad and empandas. SO good! The sangria was okay, nothing that blew me away. Was a little annoying though that we weren't brought water until halfway through our meal. Overall, it was a really nice place to go and I will be going back.	4.0
It was my last night visiting Jersey and my cousins and I wanted to do something fun since we normally don't get to see each other often. I'm the youngest of 11 and we're all of drinking age and one of my cousins suggested Cuban Pete's. Originally some of us were going to go into the city but the rain decided to ruin our fun, but this wasn't a bad backup plan. Well, not entirely good either. One of my cousins went straight to the restaurant from work to put our name on the list because apparently it gets busy (we went on a Friday night) and good thing he did. By the time I got there with my sister, cousin and her husband it was packed. The rest of our party slowly started trickling in and we waited in their little standing waiting room. Literally two hours + later we were FINALLY seated. They had told my cousin that we would be seated around 9:15pm, that was a lie. The hostesses kept making excuses that they had called for us but since we didn't answer, they gave our table away. Lies, lies, lies. We were all pretty attentive considering we were starving and one of my other cousins is pregnant, so we were definitely waiting with eager ears. One of my cousin-in-laws complained and a manager got involved and finally we got a table. As I understand it if you bring your own wine they will make the sangria for you, which is pretty cool. One of my cousins brought a couple bottles of wine and we had both red and white sangria. The white was definitely my favorite, mixed with moscatto it was definitely very tasty and fruity. My sister and I ordered an appetizer to share but ended up not even getting it. Three other people at our table ordered the same thing, but I don't even remember what it was. I guess the kitchen ran out of the food? Kind of lame. I ended up getting the churassco and I have to say the food is what's saving me from giving this place a terrible review. I am a sucker for plantains and Cuban Pete's are top notch, they were cooked just right. But my favorite had to be the rice, not too sweet but just the right amount of sweet. As for the churassco, it was okay. It could have better, meaning I wish it was a little more tender and easier to cut. It was still good and flavorful, but I've had better in Houston. I also had a bite of my sister's Ropa Vieja and that was delicious! I was definitely overstuffed by the end of the meal and my taste buds were very satisfied. The ambiance and décor of the restaurant was also nice. Definitely gave you that feeling that you teleported to Cuba for a little bit. I enjoyed the bongo drummers too. But I had to only give it 3 stars due to the poor customer service. I understand that it was a Friday night and sometimes things get hectic and busy but we had a big party and so I don't understand how losing our table was possible, or no one from our group being able to hear our name being called. Oh well. We still had a good time regardless. It was a nice little get together as I said it's been proving more and more difficult to find time for everyone to get together since everybody has their own lives, careers and kids now, so it's always nice to get to spend time with the family whenever we can.	3.0
Came here with a friend for lunch as was not disappointed. The place can get pretty loud but the food is GOOD. We tried skirt steak and chicken. Then there was dessert. YUM.	4.0
What is not to like! Nice venue, good food and good drinks to mix with what ever you bring for BYOB. I had a melon flavored mojito blend, and I brought strawberry rum. It was great together. The place is pretty loud and busy so it's best to enjoy with someone fun. The owner is super cool. My date and I had a complimentary drink, dessert, and gift card to use when we return. It doesn't get better than that.	5.0
I enjoyed the food but it just wasnt my favorite type of food so do not go by my review of the dining alone. The atmosphere is fun but very loud and the waiters sing the same happy birthday song over and over all night. A good place to go with friends for a night out. Be advised it is BYOB however they will make sangria for you (for a price) if you bring your own wine.	3.0
Food was AMAZING!! Service was AWESOME!! Sangria was FANTASTIC!! Definitely plan on coming again!	5.0
Best thing I can say is that it is a very unique looking place - you walk up this little alleyway with fake palm trees and coconuts into a courtyard of tables of people enjoying their dinner, talking and laughing. The restaurant is broken up into several separate dining areas and you can sit outside if you like. The waiters are dressed in guiaveras (spell?) and there is the sound of a traveling bongo band.  It was chaotic to get our name on the list and waited more than an hour.  Once seated, it was very loud but the food was OK - the empanadas, croquettas and goat cheese croquettas were average taste but they were not expensive.  Note:  NO LIQUOR, they have a ton of fresh sangria mixes if you BYOB.  The dessert empanadas were excellent so I left with a good taste but I would not rush back, especially on a Saturday night as we were there like 3 hours total.	3.0
Came at a friend's suggestion and she was totally right, this place is AMAZING!! Orders came in around or less than 5 minutes, the service was great even though they were quite busy, and the food was SOOOO GOOD! The suckling pig was juicy, tender, and went beautifully with white rice. I purposely didn't finish my food because I can't wait to eat it for another meal tomorrow! The only thing I didn't like about the dish was the Yuca (Latin fried potatoes) but that's just a personal reference.   Carlito way's chicken was true to its description as you could taste all the ingredients listed blending into a delicious combination with every bite. The chicken was also tender, and the yam complemented the chicken well. Also ordered a small pitcher of cuban pete's sangria. This is just enough for 2 people. It tasted refreshing and sweet and the hint of alcohol was not overwhelming at all (I don't drink often, so this was great. I was also driving, so I couldn't afford to get drunk). Unfortunately, the only fruit slices I could find were oranges but no apples at all. The other reviewers are right about the noise level, though. It adds to the ambiance and makes you feel like you're enjoying a night out in Cuba, but it is SO LOUD that even talking to a person right next to you requires much energy. Lastly, the service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and even if he wasn't around to take care of us, other staff were around and happy to help. Definitely want to come back to try more menu items and more sangrias!	4.0
SO DISAPPOINTED! My friends told me that this place was great. They forgot to mention that its BYOB and their food is not authentic cuban food at all! I first ordered the ropa vieja, which is my fav food..BUT they put way too much tomato sauce in it and not enough seasoning. Then when I didnt want to eat it the waiter asked if I wanted something else, so I got the arroz con pollo (chicken & rice) well... THAT WAS HORRIBLE TOO... never again	1.0
Cuban Pete's is A okay to me. Fun and lively atmosphere and great for groups. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive and gave us a few quality recommendations being it was our first time.  We started with a few small plates the shrimp in garlic were very tasty and tender.  The mini Cuban sandwich was really good too.  We also had empanadas (chicken) which had good flavor but were a little dry.  The sausage stuffed peppers were good too.  I had the steak churrasco in a spicy sauce, although it had good flavor and the steak was cooked to perfect temperature, it was a bit chewy. My boyfriend had the chicken in garlic and was very satisfied.  All in all we enjoyed our meal and would return.  I found the prices for food very reasonable but 14.95 for a virgin pitcher of sangria was a little steep. I think I'll just have the vino on its own next time.	3.0
I have never been treated in such a way before in my entire life - I have been to CP's several times and always enjoyed myself.  For a celebratory dinner, I went in to see how long the wait for our party of 7 would be.  The hostess referred to her manager, who's name is Domingo - he asked if all of my party was here, my response was no but on their way.  Domingo told me he couldn't tell me until my entire party was there, fine no problem, can you give me an idea of how long it might be Domingo? His response, a smirk and a no.  I asked again, "really you cant give me a general idea?"   "I'm 46 years old, I don't have to tell you anything". Needless to say I was quite taken aback (I'm 24).  I laughed it off, thinking he was trying to be funny, he wasn't.  when I asked again if he could give me an idea he smirked and said no.  I asked what his problem was, and this is where it got interesting. He continued with the "I'm 46 I don't have to answer you" schtick for some time.  I told him I had never been treated in such a way and would take my business elsewhere.  IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT, AND HIS STAFF he proceeded to threaten me, call me a "f*cking white boy" and a tough guy, etc.  At this point I became quite heated and said some less than reputable things and left in a fume. I called the restaurant a few hours later to get his name - his hostess told me DOMINGO, he then quickly snatched the phone from her and called me a "stupid f*ckin white boy, punk ass b*tch, piece of sh*t....come back here you stupid white boy, come back and watch what happens to you" This was a grown man in a management position who acted like a schoolyard punk in front of his customers and his staff.  I was and still am BAFFLED at how this situation unfolded.  I didn't realize that, because I am young, my money was any less significant to the business.   So if you decide to go to Cuban Petes and you see a "46 year old man" with a stupid little mustache and probably some various other mental issues, that's Domingo - careful what you say or you might go to fisticuffs.	1.0
Atmosphere was nice. Brings you back to cuba! haha Nice authentic cuban food for how big the menu is and how many people they can seat. Food is good, service is good, but the place is LOUD...but that's expected at Cuban Pete's!	3.0
lechon y yuca frita the waiters are very nice and i love the music playing, its loud but great salsa music.	4.0
Great food, great atmosphere, great service. I'd say the one negative is the BYOB (which to some may be a positive). The drinks are pricey considering you are providing the alcohol.	4.0
maybe i just don't know cuban food, but everything i tried here seemed a bit bland to me. after reading all the reviews, i was expecting much much more.	3.0
I came here on a Saturday and if the food wasn't anything short of excellent I would have given it 2-stars. The food was amazing, couldnt get enough of it. Its a BYOB restaurant so great news that a wine outlet was a few stores down to mix with their signature sangira. They have an extensive sangria menu which is awesome, feel free to bring whatever kind of liquor and you are guaranteed to have a great mixer with it. BUT the crowd and noise here was unbearable. There is not a high turnover with tables because the atmosphere does make you want to sit back and enjoy. But unfortunately I did not enjoy myself on  Saturday night dinner. You can probably get the biggest bang for your buck coming here on a weekday or for lunch. It was just TOO crowded and TOO loud for me to enjoy my time with friends and family.	3.0
It's totally absolutely awesome at Cuban Pete's. I guess when you are going in some place and they have really cool well thought out decor its impressive. Im a sucker for good artistic, authentic, elaborate or darling well thought out design and structure or theme. I absolutely love the way this joint was set up. Inside/outside- mini waterfall- coconuts on the walkway, vintage muscle car outfront, jamming music, great food, amazing staff .. just so nice, informative, and attentive cute boys in  guayaberas.. yummy to my tummy GO CUBA! It was pretty spacious, with the side patio walk up to outdoor dining. and more than the wonderful overall dining experience I wanna say the food is great...OK. Mojitos & sofrito.. Yummy to my tummy. Smile in your heart, and stomach awesome.	5.0
Food is DELICIOUS! I love the outfits the waiters wear....adds to the whole Cuban vibe!	4.0
LOUD! Food is delicious though. Really, really good. If you go to Cuban Pete's on a busy night, don't expect to have a conversation through your meal. It is insanely loud to the point of being annoying. I knew before putting down my name on the wait list at Cuban Pete's that the wait was going to be at least an hour. On a Saturday night at 8 p.m., the wait was an hour and a half, which forced my party to walk down the street to the local bar for a couple of beers. Once we entered, our waiter came over immediately to help us get our sangria ready, which our entire table was excited about. When it came, the entire pitcher was filled with just the juice of sangria, because YOU have to add the liquor. Question. How are we going to add the liquor? To each glass? Well, that's what we did and it didn't really work out too well. Everyone thought that the sangria was WAY TOO sweet to drink, so unfortunately, the sangria wasn't a hit as we all expected. Our entrees came within a few minutes after the drinks, which was fine because of how loud it was in the restaurant. Everyone at our table had a huge portion of food, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I enjoyed Churrasco, which is a large marinated skirt steak that was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend had a HUGE serving of Mariscada (Naked Paella), which I stupidly forgot the doggy-bag when we were leaving, but it was delicious and worth a second trip for. In conclusion. Pete. Turn down the volume. Pete. Of course I would love your sangria, but please, please help me mix the liquor because I'm trying to have a good time. I might be back, but it will probably be for a lunch date to enjoy their delicious food.	3.0
Went for lunch on the weekend. Nice Cuban atomosphere. The virgin sangria was really good, so bring in your favorite wine and they will add it in. The food was good, it was lunch so I just had appys and a pork sandwich. I think it was a bit on the pricey side for what it was.	3.0
I always go to Cuban restaurants a little skeptical.  I studied abroad in Cuba while in undergrad, and although that was years ago, the memories of the food are still fresh in my mind.  With that said nothing has to been able to compare except a few spots I've been in Miami--that is until I came to Cuban Pete's.   I was plesantly surprised how authentic and delicious the food was, especially the fried plantains.  Soooo good.  I had the Fricase de Pollo.  Its stewed chicken with potatoes, tomatoes and olives.  Reminds me of Puerto Rican stewed chicken.  Its really good.  The only underwhelming thing was the black beans-- kinda bland.  We also had sangria, which I dont remember being prevalent in Havana but it was good none the less, brought our own wine.   My boyfriend has the Mariscada.  He seemed to like it.  I'm allergic so I steered clear. What I wish they had was mojitos-- I havent had a decent one since I left Cuba. But it seems a lot of restaurants in NJ dont have liquor licenses.  They probably would have been good at it too.	5.0
Food is awesome service is great. Very noisy and gets very busy after 5pm and weeks very crowd. Luv the fact in the summer you eat outside n enjoy the weather with a great meal. Totally worth going. Been here numerous times.	5.0
Cuban Pete's is like Epcot Center for adults. Its really more about the atmosphere and less about the food. A few things to know: * You will wait for a long time for a table * The music is VERY loud, which is fine for some, but may not be the best place to go if you want to have a serious conversation * The service is friendly, but slow * There is NO alcohol in the sangria or mojitos - you have to bring your own to add in. If you think the drinks are SO good b/c you can't taste the alcohol, it's because there is none in there Now for the food - We ordered a few tapas - the bacon wrapped dates, the fried goat cheese and the fried bacalao balls. These were by far the best part of the meal. The tapas were affordable and very tasty. Portions were small tho (they are tapas) so you have to order several if you're sharing. For dinner, I had the paella. It wasn't a traditional paella at all, but more just rice with sea food. It was OK. Nothing to rave about. Honestly, anyone with a basic cooking skill could re-create it at home. The atmosphere was fun tho - and this is really the only reason to go. It's kind of weird that there are only male servers... just saying. It's loud and fun - and on a nice day, a great place to just sit outside and enjoy a few drinks (but remember to bring your own alcohol!!).	2.0
I'm giving this place 2 stars for the food which is good. Can't say everything wasn't tasty. However I cannot recommend this place to anyone unless you consider a meal in Walt Disneyworld or Chuck E Cheese a fun dining experience. The place is in complete chaos and the staff cannot juggle the activity. Went on a Friday night, there were probably 4 birthday parties of under ten year olds going on with the balloons and all. Our waiter took forever to stop by our table the few times he came otherwise we were attended by a non-English speaking bus staff. 4 of our 5 entrees arrived and I informed no less than 3 people we were waiting on a 5th entree. I don't think anyone understood what I said and didn't alert our waiter who was nowhere to be found. My wife was fed when we were ready for the check. After she got her meal it took the waiter another 30 minutes to get me back my credit card so she had plenty of time to eat. Like I said, this place has good food and if you have 2 hours for rice and beans and don't mind eating in a playground, go for it.	2.0
All I can say is...OH YEAH!   The wait can be long as they don't take reservations, but it is worth every minute  The food is amazing, the portions are large and the atmosphere is fun and energetic.  Go with a group of friends so you can try all of the different options on the menu.  Don't forget it's BYO .  There are so many mohjito and sangria choices to mix with your favorite alcohol. Where to start?  How about the tapas? Bocaditos de Sandwich Cubano-YUM Datiles-YUMMY Al Ajillo-YUMMO Papitas de Rellenas-YUMMIEST And that's all I have to say on that. For my entree I had the Lechon Asado and it was heaven.  The pork was so tender and a total win for the garlic lover that I am.  My friends all had great dishes as well and I got to taste them all.  The Arroz con Pollo is a can't miss traditional dish.  Tender juicy chicken in a saffron rice.  Totally worth every bite. The Ropa Vieja was juicy and very flavorful and one of my favorite dishes.  And finally for a little seafood there was the Mariscada.  Tender pieces of fish in an amazing tomato broth.  I would definitely have the fish on the next visit. All of the entrees were massive in size.  Don't be afraid to take it home for leftovers...they are just as good the next day. And what dinner wouldn't be complete without desert.  The best flan I've had locally aside from the homemade flan made by one of my coworkers. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.  Not to mention all of the good looking waiters that work there.  An added plus!	4.0
The wait was a bit long .. But the food was WELL worth the wait!! THe plantains are to die for!	4.0
Oh my God the paella.   I enjoyed dinner at Cuban Pete's a few months back while visiting my family in the Northern Jersey area.  Coming from a cuban family, they can be kind of critical of cuban restaurants, so when they recommended a place in Montclair I was a little surprised.   We arrived at 5:30 or so on a Sunday night and the place was jammed.  Our wait was pretty short, maybe 30-45 minutes.  We were seating somewhat awkwardly in the main courtyard.  The service started our pretty rocky in the beginning.  We were 5 seated at a table for 4.  The drinks and order input was sluggish.  One of the people in our party spoke with the manager and everything changed dramatically for the better.  Can't say enough about the food and service.  Stuff happens in life and it's all about how you recover.   I wouldn't hesitate to return.  In fact I can't wait to return for more Paella.	5.0
I mean what more could I say that 200+ people haven't already.  The food is just flat out good.  It doesnt matter what you order.  We ordered a Cuban Sandwich and the regular Skirt Steak.  The Cuban sandwich was really good... spicy mustard, pickles, pork, ham, swiss, soft but crispy bread... So niccce...   But the main event by far was the Skirt Steak.  Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, flavorful... all that.  And to top it all off the chimichurri sauce will seriously have you looking for anything to put it on and eat.  The sandwich was $8 and the steak $17.  Most dishes on the menu were above $14, so I would call this place cheap but definitely well worth it.  Nice summery Cuban ambiance.  Palms, nice color, hand painted murals on the walls, and all the waiters dress like your typical Cuban neighbor with those shirts and fedora hats.  Bring a hot new date here or your gf when you get in trouble.  No lunch specials that I know of, so lunch prices will be the same as dinner.  Prepare yourselfs... 4 *'s!	4.0
Good food, good service.  There have been times where the service was a little too slow but it has only happened on few occasions.  I love the chimichurri skirt steak!	4.0
I love this place! Amazing food, great sangria (BYOB to mix), and a great atmosphere.  You walk in and you feel like you have just walked into Havana.  It tends to get incredibly busy there on the weekends so I suggest going early, and if there is a wait, it is pretty well worth it!	4.0
I come here for the amazing food. I've gotten croquettes and chicken lollipops for an appetizer, and I've had Cuban Pete's Paella and Churrasco for entrees. Armondo's Sangria is to DIE for (YUM!!). You can always BYO to spruce up the alcohol content if you wish. If you're coming here on a Friday/Saturday, be prepared for a long wait and to bump elbows with someone at some point (one of the downsides to this place is how popular it is). I came here the other night and it wasn't too busy, our waiter paid attention to us very well up until the end of our meal and then he disappeared for half an hour! The bus boy came twice to clear our table and it wasn't until we flagged down another waiter did anyone else appear. We never saw our original waiter again that night, he had sent someone else with the check and only the explanation that he had gotten a large table (still no excuse, you see how we are yourself or you send backup earlier than that!). Other than that, service is usually good.	4.0
Going on a friday or saturday night is a little crazy. Expect to wait and be shoved in the crowded lobby but if you can just relax and be patient it is worth it! I love that it is BYOB and they have all these amazing juices ready to be mixed with whatever alcohol you bring. Last time i went we brought Coconut Ciroc and they mixed it with their pineapple mojito concoction and it was sooooo delicious! The waiters are soo friendly. The vibe is fun and lively. The food is delicious! I always get the mango glazed whole fish and this is the only place ever i have had a whole fish like that and it was delicious. They serve it with coconut rice...omg! yum yum yum	5.0
I was here with a friend of mine, and the food was yummy. The place is quite small so we were kind of chucked away in to a corner which kind of worked out as we were catching up after a long time. The wine was pretty good too. Will definetly go there again.	4.0
It only feels like you're in line for the new iPhone but in reality you're just waiting to have dinner... There's no denying the food is excellent but the wait was ridiculous; told us 45 mins but ended up being an hour and a half, and that was with arriving at 9:30pm mind you. I understand waits can be crazy but just give me a more realistic estimate so I don't leave hating you. No utensils or napkins at our table; the waiters are so busy that it took awhile for these necessities to come to us. We were there for a specific dish and when we ordered the waiter told us they ran out of it. I asked if it's like this every weekend and he said no this is pretty calm believe it or not. Ok then how did you run out of a popular dish, especially when you were expecting the evening to be even busier... Makes no sense. Dinner plates were in front of us in about 9 mins; appetizers followed 2 mins after that. For a place that sees this crowd most weekends, they seemed frazzled and didn't have a good rhythm going. My advice--go on a weekday. For lunch.	3.0
pretty grooood Cuban food... and gotta love the BYOB to have them make fresh sangria and/or mojitos!	4.0
Cuban Pete's has great Cuban food, Tapas, and Sangria. They have a very lively and fun ambiance along with their cool decor and staff that match the Cuban theme, but along with this comes the crazy chaos. The greatest downfall of this place is that they don't take reservations and you're left to wait on their stairs, with a bunch of strangers being on top of you or brushing up against you while going up or down the stairs. The waiting experience just sucks, but I guess with a place that brings in this much business, they don't need to take reservations. Even though it's hard to find parking around the area, there is a small lot in the pack where you're allowed to park from 7PM to 2AM. This place gets packed on a Friday or Saturday night so be prepared to wait. Once your table is ready, you're led to your table however watch out for the wait staff that are rushing through with food. We went during the summer so the outdoor seating area was open. It was so packed that night that we were put in an odd spot in what looked like a opening/entrance to a doorway, however we didn't care because we were finally seated and starving. This place is BYOB, so make sure to bring your own Wine to try with their different offerings of Sangria mixes. We ordered a few Tapas and dishes, however it was so long ago that I can't remember. I remember enjoying the food very much though! We'll definitely be back, especially now that the weather is getting nicer.	3.0
Liar liar pants on fire.   We were starving and craving for Cuban food.  Called Cuban Pete's to see how long the wait is.  Was told no wait. So we went with a boatul of excitement.  Arrived - saw a line going up the stairs amd was told the wait was an hour (which i guess meant for two).   What do they think they gained by lying to us I really wonder.  For the owners to let their employee do these kinds of things I really wonder what their integrity standard is like.   So don't bother calling them or anything and. Check your bill before paying.	1.0
had a serious problem with a waiter here. the manager settled it and next time i went he went out of his way to tell me that the jerk was fired and was no good anyway. then the next time i went the jerk waiter was back and made sure to bang some stupid birthday drum in my face when it was a birthday of someone across the room. foods great, managers great, wait staff could be waaaay better.	3.0
This is one of my favorite Cuban restaurants. The food is excellent and they serve you large portions. If you don't like loud atmospheres, then this is not the place for you. There is loud music always playing but I love the music so it doesn't bother me. The outside area is very cute when the weather is nice.  IU have also had work parties in the separate room and its been great.	5.0
Well, looks like I'll have to rescind my 5-star review of this establishment. To begin, the restaurant needs to rethink their concept of waiting area. When it gets really busy, you are forced to stand like a can of sardines waiting for your party to be called and then attempt to maneuver through the crowd and try to accidentally knock something over on the way there. The spacing and seating of the place is cramped and narrow. Now, in terms of customer service, it SUCKS!! When I went, I only saw my server ONCE and that was only to give me water and take my order. The food is not that great, it's bland at most. To me, it looked as if they put food coloring just to make it look healthy. Towards the end of the meal, I kid you not we spent 20 minutes LITERALLY flagging down a waiter and when that didn't get his attention we finally got up and just paid at the desk. It's such a shame because I feel like this place could have potential but there is something seriously lacking. I won't be bringing my business here anymore.	1.0

Well....this is the best cuban food I have ever had.  Tried quite a few items on the menu and have never been dissapointed.  Very crowded and noisy, but since that is what it's like in our family of six every night....I felt quite comfortable....always a line to get in, so be patient.  Definitely worth the wait!!!!	5.0
I'm an avid lover of Cuban food, and my favorite Morristown restaurant closed. My boyfriend convinced me to try Cuban Pete's and it was possibly some of the greatest food I've ever had in my life. Minus the thiry minute wait in the cold, (the staging area was so packed, it was easier to wait outside) I had the best night. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgable, a student from MSU. He directed me toward all the entrees that were gluten free and we tried three tapas dishes to start with our house made sangria. The bacon wrapped figs were insane. I wanted to order ten more to go. I had the porkchops with the most decadent plantains on the side, and my boyfriend had the ribs with a HOUSEMADE mango bbq sauce. I'm waiting for the next birthday in my group of friends to celebrate at Cuban Pete's. Great restaurant, great atmosphere. Definitely one of THE best restaurants in Jersey.	5.0
Everybody's favorite! Lots of fun and a great place to go to have an enjoyable meal and not spend too much money. In the summer, eat outside in a little courtyard and whether you're in or out, you'll feel like you're on vacation. We almost always get a bunch of tapas-- papitas rellenas, chorizo, rice, black beans and then switch it up- garlic shrimp is good, as are the mussels and clams.  I think the chicken lollipops are overrated. Their non-alcoholic sangria- you bring wine and they mix it for you- is a little overpriced I think , but awesome and worth it, especially on a nice spring or summer afternoon- if you're in the mood for strawberries, peaches, citrus and lots of sweetness, bring white wine and get the Armando's Passion.	4.0
Love, love, love this place. I recommend the Enchilado with yellow rice.  I wish they took reservations, as the wait is a little long on the weekends. However, it is well worth the wait! :-)	5.0
Welcome to the Olive Garden of "Cuban" food! Friends have raved about this place to me, and frankly, I couldn't be more disappointed as a true lover of Cuban food. It's BYOB (Ok, I'm not taking too much off of them because in most of NJ a liquor license is not easy to get), but the Pineapple virgin mojito's we got were just rubbish. I could've gotten something better out of a can of Dole, quite frankly. The food - The Pollo Cubano was the best thing that arrived on the table, but even that was not particularly flavorful or original - frankly, it was nothing more than a rotisserie chicken with white rice and black beans that I feel like I could get anywhere. The empanadas were dry and frankly the worst empanadas I've ever had in my life (Maybe they are indeed from the frozen foods section?). Was not impressed by either the Cuban Sandwich or Garlic Shrimp, and frankly, the mojito sauce chicken we got was inedible. The atmosphere was so very "Rainforest Cafe" that I was ready to ask where their other locattions were and where I can get my Cuban Pete's t-shirt. (Not a compliment)...and while I have absolutely no complaints about our waiter, hearing them bring the drums out within our room for 5 birthdays within a  2-hour lunch gave me a headache. As I write this, I am eagerly planning a visit to a real Cuban restaurant with good food.	2.0
visited this place twice in a week!! everything i had was dellish and the wait was sooo worth it!! definitely try the flan and drink up all the sangria possible... so many options its hard to choose where to start..	5.0
Best Skirt Steak! Great atmosphere and decor but very loud, which I am cool with. Be careful if you order the fish and don't know what you are doing it may come out as a fish with head, tail, and all!  Bring your own wine and they will make you a great Sangria!	5.0
I know. Five stars usually means either the person writing the review is related to the owner of the place or they have no real sense of what good food and a good restaurant is about. I'm not related to anyone there (I'm German-American) and I have culinary background, owned my own cafe, and have worked in both the front and back of restaurants. I'm also really picky about service and food quality. Cuban Pete's is a great restaurant. Really! The decor is bright, cheerful, full of very good artwork and photos. It does have a very slight "chain" restaurant look to it, but not much. (It's not a chain by the way and I hope they don't aspire to that. That's always the death of a good restaurant.) The service was perhaps the best I've experienced in years. When I waited tables (many years ago) the rule was that  you greeted the person at your table within two minutes, even if it was to tell them that you'd be right back to take care of them or to take a drink order while they looked at the menu. Over the years, I've developed a real impatience with the usual sitting at a table waiting for what can sometimes be a really long time to even be acknowledged by our server. My policy now is not to wait more than five minutes before asking for a manager. Longer than that, I just leave unless there's a really good reason to stay. Our server, a young man named Anthony was one of those increasingly rare servers who does his job *very* well. He was at our table in less than a minute with menus, took our drink order, and returned promptly. He took our appetizer order and then gave us time to consider our entree choices. During the meal, he was attentive but not in a way that way overly attentive - which can be as annoying as being ignored! He explained the menu when my wife had questions and made certain that our food was prepared the way we ordered it. The food was excellent. I grew up in and around Union City, NJ, in the '50s and '60s and many of my friends were Cuban so I always ate the best Cuban food around. The food at Cuban Pete's brought me right back to those days. Churrasco, plantains, rice and beans, pollo, flan..all great. And the appetizer of almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon (something I'd never had) was incredible. We ordered it twice! I don't drink, but my daughter loved the sangria and she's as fussy as I am. And apparently Cuban Pete's is known for their sangrias. If you want a delicious Cuban meal, Cuban Pete's is the place to go. I'm looking forward to going back in the warmer weather and enjoying it again outdoors in their courtyard!	5.0
Yummy!!! Going back soon to try another dish! Maybe "pargo". Wait staff very polite and didn't rush us off. Portions were more than enough. The noise level is a bit high but you know that from the minute you step in. For those that complaint about the noise level...if you sit down and stay a while you know the noise level. Focus in the lively, cheerful atmosphere plus a wonderful menu to choose from! You will no be disappointed.  Ok I'm off to my siesta! Boy that meal has me sleepy lol	5.0
I was a Cuban Pete's supporter since the very beginning, and I will continue to be until the day they decide to close. Wonderful Cuban cuisine as diverse as its patronage. FLAVORFUL! Keep up the good work.	5.0
Cuban Pete's is a like a Disney version of Cuban cuisine -- the atmosphere is good and the decor seems authentic, but the food is a bland Americanized version of the real thing.	3.0
I came to Cuban Pete's with my office for a late Holiday lunch. They says they have a parking lot but it's was very small, to the point where no one got a spot at 230 in the afternoon. As for the Décor, it was pretty well themed.  The outside area looks like it would be nice to dine in when it's warmer out. It does feel a little cramped though, one of my coworkers and my boss are in a wheelchair and it was a little tight navigating into the place and to our table. However, the staff was super friendly; everyone was chipper. The food was pretty good. I ordered Pete's Paella, which was good and a fair size portion. I also tried some of the bacon wrapped dates, which were delicious. For dessert, I got the Flan Cubano, which was very good and I tired one of the girls Tres Leches which I would order again.   Overall a good place I would go for lunch, I think if I waited over an hour for dinner as some review indicate, my opinion might change.	3.0
Where should I start.  I have been to Cuban Pete's a few times now.  After my last experience, I will never go back.   First, problem number one is: the wait time.  We were told 45 minutes and waited one hour and forty five minutes.  Totally unacceptable.  If they were honest about the whole wait time, I could have left and gone somewhere else to eat instead of wasting our time.  Maybe, they should hire a hostess who knows how to do their job. second: The noise in the place is a deafening white noise.  I felt like i had a buzz going on without the alcohol.  Too, many people in one area.  I wonder if they are going above the fire code of occupancy for the restaurant?  Someone should check with the local fire department.   Third: The food is harshly over salted and tastes like you are basically eating salt licks.  All food tastes good with a mass amount of salt.  If, I wanted that, I would go to Friday's or some other chain.  I do not need my doctor making more money off of me due to high blood pressure from food. Fourth: When I went to order food the first item I picked was sold out.  Strike one.  I picked something else.  Sold out.  Strike two.  I asked to speak with the manager.  I told him we waited one hour forty five minutes and both items I chose were not available any more.  He tells me you are mad because we are sold out of items?  Yes, I am.  Also due to the wait.  He said "what do you want me to do about it".  I told him I am also made about the wait.  He said "if I were you I would have left".  Good, managing there sir.  Tell a patron to just leave, because you do not care for their business. A few things wrong here about how to not manage a restaurant:  Hire a chef who knows how many people come into the restaurant and learn how much to order as far as food goes.  A good chef would not allow this to happen on a busy night.  Do not allow your patrons to wait longer for food that is sub par to that of Taco Bells.   At one point I asked the manager who the owner was and he told me.  I asked if he would rather have a customer walk out due to being unhappy.  He said "he does not care, because this is Cuban Pete's".  Okay.  Nice attitude.  This is why I will not ever patronize this restaurant ever again. We wallked out after my conversation with the manager.  Apparently, my business is not wanted.  No problem.  I will also make it a point to tell everyone I know personally and electronically to not patronize this chemical smelling, salt bomb food serving, annoyingly loud, and over crowded mediocre restaurant. There a plenty of restaurants in the area much better and who's management treats you way better.  I would rather go a place that wants my money and business. To all who read this please heed my review.  Go to a better run place of business.  Do not go to a place that will only disappoint your tastebuds.  Or, make you wake up with cotton mouth.	1.0
We have been here several times for dinner. We hosted a party  a few weeks ago and had a great time. I love the bacon wrapped dates and my son loves the chicken wing appetizers.For dinner they make delicious short ribs. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Cuba.  The service was very good and the place is kid friendly.	5.0
I cannot find any redeeming qualities about this place.  As always, I will keep my review to areas that are objective.  I was told this was THE place to go for Cuban cuisine; that this is the place to measure other Cuban restaurants against.  SO NOT TRUE!   We arrived around 7pm on a weeknight; they took my name and asked that we go 'up the stairs' to wait.  In the half a minute we went up the stairs, we were immediately called to our table.  We were seated at a small table in the middle of a high traffic area, but I cannot fault them for that.  We sat down and it took well over 10 minutes for a server to show his non-smiling face.  We ordered appetizers (tapas style) of stuffed peppers and meatballs.  Peppers ware mediocre and the meatballs were terrible.  Despite being served in some type of white sauce, the meatballs were dry as sand.. so much so, they had a hard crust on the outside.  Even the sauce didn't help.  Entrees were just as bad.  We both had chicken dishes; dry, lacking flavor and just disappointing.  Even the black beans they served were bland.  Neither the server or runner that brought the food ever smiled or acknowledged anything more than an occupied table.  Neither of us finished our meals (or the meatballs).  We sat there, with the majority of the food left on our plates, and the waiter NEVER came back and asked how our food was, if there was anything we needed, how we were doing.. he never even came back to pour us more sangria (which we brought our own wine for).  Oh, and we never were even offered water!  After I flagged the waiter, he asked if I wanted the check and if everything was good.  I said no, it wasn't okay and that the food was not acceptable.  He immediately replied that he would get the manager.  The manager, a woman named Ryann, came over and the first thing she said was "do you have a question".  Here we are, sitting with the majority of our food on our plates 45 minutes into our time at the table, and she thinks we had a question?!  So, I proceed to tell her that the food was unacceptable (all of the points I mentioned above), that the service was poor in that the waiter never checked on us, and (again) reviewed how bad the food was.  She asked if we wanted something else.  I told her that we had been sitting there with dry, tasteless food in front of us for 45 minutes with no one even checking on us, and I am not NOW going to give them another shot.  I restated that the food and service was poor and unacceptable.  She replied with (and I say this honestly) "well, did you flag down your waiter?"  Not only an unbelievable statement to make to a customer (putting fault on me for not reaching out to him) but she did this while making the gesture of flagging someone down, as if I didn't know how.  Now, my boyfriend HATES when I make complaints to the manager (though he always feels they are valid, he just doesn't like to 'make a fuss'), but at this point his jaw had dropped and I could see fire in his eyes.  I was done and didn't want to sink to as low of a level as this manager.. so, I simply responded by asking again for our check so we could leave.  $56.44.. 2 apps @$4 each, 2 entrees at $15 each.  That's $38.  We had a pitcher of their juice mix to make the sangria (our wine).. so that means the pitcher of sangria mix was around $15.  I think that's a little high. Anyway, we left and, as leaving, I was stopped by another person who I thought was another manager (he stopped briefly while the first manager was 'handling' us).  He reached out to me, apologized and offered me a $50 gift certificate.  I, reluctantly, accepted.  He apologized profusely, stated that they (Cuban Petes) are better than that and acknowledged that the 'managers' handling of the situation was completely inappropriate.  He further advised that he was actually the owner and really wanted an opportunity to prove to us they are better than that.  I accepted and am still undecided about returning.  My boyfriend, however, is adamant that he will not grace their doorway ever again.   The place was packed as we were leaving, so others have either found some redeeming quality or came here based on others' reviews.  Either way, this place is not worth the wait, time or even the energy it takes to walk from the car to the front door.	1.0
Went to Cuban Pete's for the first time with a party of 5 to celebrate my dad's birthday. We are latin and thought the food was SALTY and mediocre at best. The sangria was not tasting like sangria at all , but had a heavy soda taste with an unrecognizable other taste non of us could figure out. The place was nicely decorated and was very laid back, but the service could have also been better, our waiter seemed rushed and had NO smiles for us that day :( at all. It was an early afternoon and the atmosphere was good, plenty of people, music and conversations going on, so it can get a bit loud. bad thing is I wont be recommending this place any time soon.	2.0
Went to Cuban Pete's with a friend of mine who is Cuban. I was immediately reminded of Miami and South Florida.  The atmosphere and decor will take you straight there.   For food order a bunch of appetizers. all were pretty good all though the portions were on the smaller side. For the main course had a shredded chicken dish. The meat was very tender but the chef was heavy on the salt shaker. I give Cuban Pete 's 3 stars overall, I will eventually return and if the food is not so salty will bump my rating to 4 stars.	3.0
The meat in the beef stew was very tender	3.0
Cuban Pete's is able to create a bustling tropical village vibe which should be experienced.  The dining room is impossibly loud, and the outdoor courtyard not much better.  Having spent a lot of time in South Florida lately sets a very demanding standard for assessing the quality and taste of Cuban food.  While not inauthentic, Cuban Pete's food is a solid "6" of a possible 10.  The skirt steaks, in particular, are tasty-- but this is a cut which implodes when grilled beyond the "medium" point.  I'm much less impressed with their rendition of the Cuban pulled pork "ropa" dishes, as they lack the depth of flavor gained by authentic slow cooking.  The appetizers include many tasty (and garlicky) choices, and are generally better than the entrees.  Cuban Pete's is a place where the sangria flows freely; loud, and bit chaotic, but an enjoyable Caribbean party setting.  Attempting conversation indoors is virtually pointless.  Overall, a fun experience when the mood strikes.  Please read my rating as 2.50 stars.	2.0
Coming from a Cuban-American raised on Cuban food, this place cooks their cuisine similar to the home cooking I grew up on.  I'm seriously amazed their food tasted so authentic! My husband and I ordered a pitcher of a perfect mojito and I had the bistec empanizado with arroz and frijoles negros. The steak was crisp outside and mouth watering and juicy on the inside. The rice was plump and soft. Cannot say enough about how much I loved this place.  Paradise found in NJ!	5.0
What can be said that hasn't been said before? It's just not my style. Do you like to have people screaming at you...or wait, even better, do you want to wait in line for 45 minutes, to have people bark at you when your party is ready to be seated, have a waiter speak VERY LOUDLY to you, and for you to yell back and forth at the person sitting directly across from you? It's loud as fuck, food is just mediocre at best, they rush you, and there is never a point in time when you can just sit, relax, and enjoy your damn 12 dollar sangria. For what its worth, its almost a novelty of Montclair, so you kind of have to go and decide if you like it or not.  Personally, if it wasn't for the fact that I purposely slam my drinks in order to generate a quick buzz to cause unawareness to my surroundings, I would hate Cuban Petes...like, loathe it.  However, they never gave me shit about getting sloppy over my tapas, so I can not completely disregard its existence. The suckling pig is one of the best items on the menu.  Get that.	2.0
I LOVE this place!!! I always order 6-8 tapas to split among the table and I always leave full and happy! I would suggest the goat cheese fritters, datiles, papitas and pequino rellenas. All are amazing and a must have when I'm there. They are BYOB so bring your favorite wine and have a great time!	5.0
Omg what a great place! You have to try the Ricky Rocardo's Ribs, beef ribs fall off the bones, braised in apricot and served with rice/beans and yuca!!!! Amazing!!!!	5.0
Just left this place. There was a hair in my fish. I sent it back, however I cut my fish in a certain spot to make sure they would give me a new dish instead of just taking the hair out and playing it off as if it was a new dish. Minutes later they bring me a new dish..surprise, surprise! They gave me a fish with a cut in the exact same place. Coincidence? Nope! This place is disgusting.	1.0
Brilliant! Amazing atmosphere and food, can't beat that combo! Their staff is quick and friendly and the food is to die for.  It is a beautiful place to eat indoors in the cold or rain, but the real treat there is their outdoor dining area.  There is a feeling of being transported to a totally different place as soon as you step thru the doors, which you never expect from the exterior. If you haven't eaten here yet, please do yourself a favor and try it out!	5.0
What a pleasant surprise! No idea this place was here. The food, service, and location were just perfect. The closest to authentic Cuban cuisine I've had in a while. Would recommend highly. BYOB.	3.0
Been here twice now....LOVE this place!  Great atmosphere....can get a little loud, so this isn't a place to bring that romantic date to.  Best sangria around, and the food is awesome too.   First time I was here, I had the chimichurri steak, with rice and beans and plaintains.  Flank steak is very easy to overcook, and can taste like rubber when not done right.  This was tender, and melted like butter.  This time I had the breaded steak, which was fried to perfection.   As I said before, the sangria here is excellent.  Just remember to bring your own bottle of wine, as they do not have a liquor license.  They have an open courtyard, which is great in the summer too.	5.0
I ate here about a year ago and have been wanting to go back ever since!! I fell in love with the atmosphere!! I didn't feel like I was in New Jersey (besides the cold weather!) --more like Key West! The service was GREAT and the food was even better! I would definitely love to go back.	5.0
I'm from Florida, so I know Cuban food, and this place is awesome. But you have to know what to order. The best things on the menu are the ropa viejo and lechon asado. Sooooo good. Make sure you ask for chimichurri and garlic mojo sauce on the side. The steak Milanese is good too. It is BYOB. If you bring wine they can put it in their sangria, but their sangria isn't that great. The wait is always long, and there is no room to wait, so everyone is cramped into the entryway and this awkward staircase. The place is loud and vibrant.	5.0
Came here on a Friday night with two other people. It was PACKED, which was to be expected. We didn't have to wait too long for a table. The food was alright -- coconut rice is phenomenal -- but the steak and chicken that was ordered at my table wasn't the greatest. The wait service was awful. I will give them the benefit of the doubt because it was a busy Friday night, but our waiter spent maybe a total of 5 minutes at our table, and that was only to take our orders and bring our food. He was rude, had zero sense of humor, and rushed us. If you don't like going to places where you have to scream at the person right next to you for them to be able to hear you, then I'd avoid Cuban Pete's, especially since the food was only slightly above average.	3.0
I wanted to update this review because I must say that the service at Cuban Petes is a whole lot better.  I remember back in the day it would take forever to get anything from your waiter but these days the waitors are much nicer and much faster.  I have taken all of my co-workers when they are in town and they love it.  Just be ready to hear the conga drum blasting in your ear every 5 minutes as they sing happy birthday.  Also, the Tres Leches is not just pretty good, it's damn near amazing.  The best Tres Leches of any restaurant that I have been to.  I also tried the Dessert empanadas and they were pretty good as well.  Also, be careful if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday in a big group.  It is going to be very hard to plan and they will only seat you if your entire group is present.  Enjoy.....	5.0
So this restaurant used to be a great place to go and enjoy good food but not anymore.  The restaurant has a pretty atmosphere and a lovely outdoor area for great dining in the Spring or Summer.  For the most part, the waiters are friendly and attentive as best as they can be considering this restaurant gets PACKED!  Unfortunately, we were not so fortunate in getting one of the aforementioned waiters on our last vist.  Our waiter was unattentive, messy and rude.   Now the food...mediocre at best!  The appetizers are really small so if you intend on sharing make sure to order plenty.  The dinners...large portions but I definitely wouldn't say everything is fresh.  The rice seems to sit for a long time, the plaintains (Tostones) were served somewhat hard in the center and soft when they're supposed to be a little crunchy...the sweet plaintains (Maduros) were served cold, dry and not very sweet.  The skirt steak was stringy...the breaded steak was served cold.  The Sangria was ehhhhh...considering it's a BYOB you would think they would make it slightly stronger or request how you would like it. Last but not least...if you're going there to enjoy conversation with friends...consider going somewhere else.  This place is LOUD!  OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD!!!  They tend to sing happy birthday, on request, for anyone celebrating a birthday...about 3-5 waiters gather with a drum...start banging on the drum and scream...not sing...happy birthday. This can happen several times a night.  With that said...I would not recommend this restarant to anyone!	2.0
One of my favorite restaurants!!! Food is great at good prices. Apps are a bit small, but with the size of the entree, it balances out nicely. Birthday celebrations turn in to a big fiesta when the waiters sing 'Happy Birthday'. Very popular place, so the wait times are a bit long, but soooo worth it.	5.0
COCKROACHES!!!!COCKROACHES!!!!COCKROACHES!!!! Yes, they have cockroaches and I will tell you how I know, but you have to read this whole review first (or you can just scroll to the end and spoil the surprise). I first heard about this restaurant from 2 co-workers. They really talked highly of the food, in particular: the meal that consists of coconut and fish and the sangria. Man was I excited. I looked it up on yelp. 4 Stars, not bad. Some reviews complained about the service, loud music, and wait time for a table. I was not deterred. So my wife and I went tonight, which is a Tuesday. We are seated at a table right away and our server arrives within a reasonable time frame. We end up ordering the red sangria (first time having non-alcoholic sangria), roast pork for myself and the coconut fish for my wife. The food came in about 5-10 minutes. Not bad. The food is awesome. I don't know what they put in the white rice but it was amazing. The pork and fish were also really good and there was plenty of it. Sangria was also delicious. They only thing we ordered after that was a Cubaccino (cappuccino already sweetened). Ok, so here comes the good part. While we are waiting for the check I notice on the sangria pitcher that there are some ants crawling around. Not exactly the most sanitary but it doesn't really bother me. Ants get in shit and you can't get them out, deal with it. But when our waiter came he pulled out his server book thing (don't know the proper terminology) grabbed our check and while pulling it out BAM!!! Motherfucking cockroach comes shooting down the table almost too fast for me to kill it. Almost too fast... I am assuming that the roach came from the waiter's apron, was hiding in his book and fell from there onto our table. This led me to the sobering fact that the restaurant probably had the roaches first then this poor guy took some home with him and has them too. The roach I killed was just looking to hitch a ride on someone new and start a new home. THAT PERSON COULD BE YOU!!!! If that doesn't keep you away then be my guest because the food was great.	1.0
The place was extremely busy (which I hear is normal) and I was waiting to be seated on a narrow staircase with my friends.The owner came up to me and we had an amazing conversation about global politics. Not only did he constantly compliment me, he offered me a $100 voucher for use at the restaurant on my next visit !! ! When I told him I was with 3 other people and if he would make it 4 $25 ones (so I could give one to all of my friends) he did that with no problem. He then personally sat us with his favorite waiter and made me a special meal (since what I originally wanted was not available) which was delicious. Amazingly delicious Cuban food. Everything from the steak to the empanadas to the plantains were seasoned perfectly. It is BYOB but they can make drinks from what you bring.   Although it was busy we felt as if we were the only table there. The owner even walked us to the door and made us promise to return. Wonderful experience. I will be going back with my friends.	5.0
I love Cuban Petes, because of the atmosphere.  You really feel like you're on a tropical island!  The waiters all wear Cuban shirts, hats, and they play bongo drums for special celebrations.  It is bring your own and you can mix your favorite wine in the sangria or mojito pitchers that they have.  The meat is always very tender and feels like it melts in your mouth.  The coconut fish is also really great and sweet!  I enjoy mostly all of the tappas that they offer.  The tappas are cute and a little portion of food, but very inexpensive so you can try a bunch.  You can eat inside or outside, but I would suggest outside!	5.0
After the last two visits prior to tonight being a walk-out, after waiting almost 20 minutes for a waiter to come to the table (who arrived with an attitude like WE were the holdup) and a disappointing overall experience at the last go'round we've found this place has gone from a five to a one. What an unbelievable shame! This was a massive favorite of ours, but sadly the crowd is now too much to bear, which makes the noise too much to bear, which makes the INCESSANT birthday celebrations too much to bear. There was a time when that rotten drum was charming and fun. The whole place clapped and chimed in....but in one dinner, when you're desperately trying to converse over the rest of the din, only to be interrupted every 5 to 6 mi-*BOOMBOOM-BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM-BOOMBOOM-­BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM!!!!!!*-AN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE BIRTH.......day......song........drum....... Eh...you get the picture. There went the atmosphere. Additionally, the hosting staff is inexcusably rude these days. We waited for over 30 minutes, and when we finally questioned what the holdup was we were told that they called us already, so they'll squeeze us in next. Four of us, most with quite decent hearing, with our ears keyed into the host-stand the entire time did not once hear our party's name uttered. Not...Once... (yet the hostess insisted we were called, to the point of defensiveness). Absolutely not. Bravo Sierra, period. That host stand is about as disorganized as they come. We were overlooked and/or accidentally crossed out. End of story. The food isn't what it used to be either. I expect a little grease with my chorizo and goat cheese fritters. Of course it will be on the Ricky Ricardo Ribs as well, but our last two visits has granted us food practically swimming in it. Misshapen and soggy fritters, dripping chorizo, and nearly floating plantains...it's brutal now. Our waiter, Chris, was adequate and, thankfully, polite (a rarity in our latest experiences). Unfortunately, his hard work is not enough to make us interested in this establishment again. Pete has gotten too big for his britches, I'm afraid. There are tons of other restaurants in this neck of the woods that we'll favor being able to speak to each other in. They are also without a half hour wait time on a rickety staircase as we all hold our breath with every speeding waiter carrying a handful of sangria pitchers who nearly kills a guest risking life and limb trying to put their name in for a table. Done. With. Cuban. Pete's.	1.0
MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE! i went here last week with my mom when it was just the two of us for dinner. Since the students have been returning to the university, the narrow staircase and the small bit of room around the hostess desk were crowded with people. We waited for a good twenty minutes as the waiters walked past us with great-looking food and fetching those tasty mojitos with those funny hats on and it was surprising to us that we got a table. What was even better was how prompt the service was. Honestly, i have never seen my dinner come out so soon after ordering in my life, they must cook all the dishes a little ahead of time to handle the crowd or something. Our waiter was very nice, he went to get me an extra dish of plantains as soon as I asked and the watermelon mojito we had was DELICIOUS! Oh, and the food! THE FOOOOD! My mom had this typical Cuban steak that was so juicy and yummy and mmmm! I had about three tapas dishes and I don't remember them all but I seem to recall a beef-filled potato circle and something fried with ground beef in the middle of it. Such taste! We had to keep our leftovers and bring them home. Of course, by the time i had got them back to the oven three days later, the steak had mostly dried up but the plantains and the rest were still scrumptious! Can't wait to come back! I think I have a new favorite New Jersey restaurant!	5.0
It's loud and kind if uncomfortable.   The staff didn't come around enough for us to enjoy dinner.  The sangria tasted like a disgusting fruit juice so we walked to the liquor store bought wine and added to it.  Overall not such a pleasant experience.	2.0
This place used to be amazing when it first opened. But like alot of places in Montclair, word got out and the place got ridiculously crowded. When that happened, the food quality decreased and the service suffered. If you come here on a weekend night, forget about it. Food may or may not come out fast, but expect long waits for refills, deserts and checks. I've been here ALOT and on different occasions, I've been stiffed on drinks, I've had to wait an hour for a table, then 45 minutes after ordering for food. No exaggeration! My suggestion is come here for an early dinner or for a weekend lunch and get tapas. Or if you plan ahead and bring a huge group to celebrate an event, its alot of fun. If you're just looking for a dinner out, there are a ton of other places with better food and service.	2.0
If you're looking for a dinner experience that will make you feel like you've been whisked away to a tropical island- look no more!! I've been to Cuban Pete's twice- once with my boyfriend and once more recently with my boyfriend's family to celebrate an anniversary.  The first time, we sat inside.  It was pleasant, the food and service were good and it was relatively empty if I recall correctly.  Nothing memorable about it in a good or bad way.   More recently, we sat outside since it was a beautiful summer night.  Be warned- come EARLY!  We showed up around 5:30 and were told we got the last big table available.  It quickly got more and more crowded as we sat for dinner.  I had called earlier in the day for reservations and they don't take any.  The girl on the phone said the wait time can run anywhere from 15 min to 2 hours- that's helpful in planning. We were misled into thinking you couldn't bring alcohol since they sell sangria (which is really good I might add!) but in reality it's BYO like most of Montclair so I would recommend doing so. Both times, I thought the food was really good.  Though I can't speak to it's true Cuban authenticity since I don't have it very often.  The portions are very generous- you'll probably need a doggie bag.  The food came out incredibly quickly both times I've been there.  If you are hungry, you won't have to wait long once you're seated. One thing I didn't enjoy on my second trip was the service.  The server barely spoke English.  Actually, he barely spoke at all- except to say "are you ready?" several times while we were all clearly still deciding what we wanted.  Once we ordered, we never saw him again until it was time to try and sell us on dessert and/or bring us the check and get us out.  We had to flag down some other server to open our bottle of wine for us and no one ever checked to see if we needed anything else once our entrees came. The other thing I wasn't crazy over- as someone else mentioned- is the way they handle their wait.  There really isn't a place for people to stand around so as we were eating, one couple with their stroller basically stood over the table the server told them was going to be theirs and pressured the couple currently finishing up to leave sooner.  That would have definitely ruined my dining experience.   Food, drink and atmosphere get 4 stars but I gave a 3 because of poor service- almost to the point of rude and neglectful.	3.0
The restaurant it really cute, the outdoor seating / courtyard is a great spot, especially for montclair.  The palm trees and fountain really set a nice atmosphere. I have been wanting to try this place for years, but never wanted to wait on a Fri or Sat night.  Finally went on a Wed night and got a seat pretty quickly, however the place filled up fast.  The service was not good, our waiter was not friendly and disappeared for quite some time.  The food was just OK, nothing to rave about.  I would say I would try it again and hope the food and service is better.	2.0
When i visited my cousins in New Jersey and New York...coming to this spot was probably he highlight of my whole trip. I hated the east coast because it was hot as hell and humid as fuck. let me just say the west coast is definitely the best coast...without a doubt mans...but anyways...the food here was soooooo bomb...the sangrias booooomb...the service was boooomb...ambiance bommmmb...spending time with my east coast fam...bommmbbb....oh and me and my cousin in law setting up my bf for a surprise happy bday stunt...HILLLLLARIOUS HAHAHAHAS...it wasn't even my bf's birthday but we told the waiters it was so later on they started coming around with their drums and those mexican rattle thingys...wow that was intense...anyways bottom line...i love this spot mans...	5.0
If you hate greasy food, loud atmosphere, and crowded places then this place is not for you. Food is okay. Tried the Cuban Burger and it was pretty good. Seemed fresh, well seasoned. I always get the Cubachino, get it? Cappuccino? Har har. Don't know why they added the chino part. Thougth it would have some kind of Chinese stuff on it lol.	3.0
Great food but very LOUD	3.0
First off, the food here isn't bad. The tapas stuff is generally good and the vegetarian paella was also good. The problem with Cuban Pete's, however, starts the moment you walk into the place. They seem to have scoured the earth to find the most unfriendly hostesses on earth. I don't expect to be fawned over, but being outright rude for no reason is pretty absurd. We got to Cuban Pete's one Saturday around 7 pm and the place was packed. So we gave the hostess our name and asked her how long the wait would be. She says 30 minutes. We decide that's fine enough and tell her we would be waiting outside the door in their patio area, where they have some tables and a bench. She says fine. 45 minutes go by and we still haven't been called, so my wife goes up to ask her how much more time she thinks it will be. She then looks over the list and says that we lost our table 10 minutes back and that we should have paid attention. My wife gets annoyed and tells her that we didn't see anyone come out and call, whereupon she rudely says that "we do not call outside". My wife then asks her why she didn't say this when we told her we were going to be outside. She again literally parrots the "we do not call outside" line 2 more times and refuses to acknowledge us after that. I must also mention here that instead of having a waiting area or seats or benches, Cuban Pete's insists that you stand in front of the restaurant, mashed up against 30 more people. If that isn't an enormous fire hazard I don't know what is.  So the lesson here is, be prepared to wait in a crowd of 30 people in a tiny room for 30 minutes and be prepared to be spoken rudely to for getting some average Cuban food back in return. Thanks but no thanks.	1.0
I've been here a few times but this was the last of it!!!! i went on a date of course on a friday night, they're packed beyond belief.  Wait time was 20-25 min... so left my name and we waited. 30 min later i see people coming in and being seated within 5 mins. i asked the seating hostess and she said she 'accidentally' crossed out my name and that i would be seated next.  so again we waited. a cute couple walks in and AGAIN she seats them within 5 mins. That was the IT!!! i went up to her and reminded her that we were still waiting.... apparently she forgot... right before i was going to lay into her... the manager saw me and asked me the problem.  I let him know that we were waiting for almost an hour at this point.  He immediately seated us. We finally had a chance to order and they ran out of what we wanted. So, we ordered something else and the food was not as good as it once was.  some things tasted as tho it was watered down.  The only tasty thing they had were empanadas and we had the last 2.  The food was definitely NOT worth the price.  the only nice thing i can say is that i liked the location. BEWARE!!!	1.0
Food was delicious and fairly inexpensive.  That's great, as you'll need the $$ for hearing aids as the music is deafening!  Because of that, I would not come back..  And you'll find an average wait of 30 mins.  With all the options in Montclair, why would I bother?!?	2.0
Loved this place! It was a rainy Friday night, and there was a good amount of people waiting on the stairs, but at 7:30 we waited about 10 minutes.  (this may be atypical). CP's is BYOB, so we brought 4 bottles of wine between 4 girls. Since their service is SO quick, we were only able to get through our 3rd. We started off with empanadas-the veggie with guac was delicioso! For our main course we had Red Snapper, Paella and a chicken dish.  Everything was delicious and very satisfying proportions. Plus the homemade hot sauce was great! Lastly we split 2 deserts, banana empanada and chocolate pudding.  The pudding was amazing, the empanada was mediocre- salty & sweet, hot& cold all in one bite. Our meal came out to $25/piece. But the price feels alright knowing your bottle of wine was really cheap! The waitstaff was great, and when it's someones birthday they come out with drums, flicker the lights and sing. Amazing time, well worth the wait! Cons: my friends and I hadn't seen each other in a long time & were there to catch up. The music was too loud for old friends to gather, but would be perfect for friends who see each other often.	5.0
Came here with a large party of work colleagues for a happy hour and dinner. It was so hot but we decided to sit outside. The sun was beaming on my face for nearly an hour so cold water and sangria were a must! We brought 2 bottles of red and 1 bottle of white. We ordered 3 pitchers with 3 different mixes, all of which were great. Instead of tapas, I tried the Cuban Pete's paella. As far as paella goes, it was OK. The service is friendly (they play drums and sing happy birthday to guests very animatedly and loudly). Would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for sangria and tapas!	3.0
The best Cuban food I ever had in my life! Good music, friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere. If you order the right meal, you can split it for two people. I recommend the seasoned Steak and Sangria. Good prices considering the authenticity of the cuisine. Unbelievably good. Bring Pete to the Bronx, otherwise, I will have to keep driving to Montclair!	5.0
Great food.  Authentic Cuban food.  Byob and bring some Bacardi to  spike your Mojitos lol	5.0
My natural curiousity always wondered how good this place was, considering how long of a wait/line there always seems to be. My boyfriend took me here on a weekday evening and it was just as crowded as usual. After a half hour wait (supposedly good for this place) we were eventually seated in an outdoor area. There were two tables available, one was being drenched by some stupid waterfall, while the other was all the way in a corner up against a fence. We decided to take the corner table.  Sorry to say folks, but nothing really stuck out at this place. Appetizers are decent from what I can tell, but the entree (coconut shrimp) was extremely mediocre. The noise, crowds, and wait, are really not worth it for the service you're getting.	3.0
I LOVE CUBAN PETE'S!!!!!t!!!! I have friends that live in Edison whom I visit about 3-4 times a year and it's become tradition to go to Cuban Pete's while I'm there. Last time, one of  my friends suggested we go somewhere else but I refused. The food is great. I always get the Vaca Frita bc it's my favorite but I've sampled everyone else's food and haven't tasted anything bad. The meals are average price but the portions are HUGE. I can never finish my plate,  even if I tried. What I love just as much as the food is the  atmosphere; you really feel like you're somewhere else and their birthday song is cute (they bust out drums and everything). Be sure to save room for dessert, the Gloriana Empanadas are awesome. O yea, they don't have a liquor license so if you'd like to enjoy an adult beverage or two with your meal be sure to bring some!	5.0
Love love love this place during warm weather.  They have great outdoor space but some areas are unshaded. They could use a few umbrellas here and there. Their food is delicious and after about a few tapas, you are pretty much full.  BYOB for Sangria is a great idea. I have been here more than a handful of times and the service is hit or miss.  I would have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the "misses".  C'mon guys - put on a damn smile! Those Cuban fedoras can't hide the grouch under there! Nevertheless, there is definitely a reason why people always come back here and it's the food and ambience of the place. Nothing like it in Essex county.	3.0
I have a love/hate relationship wih Cuban Pete's.  I really enjoy their food and sangria.  I typically order the mojito chicken with rice and yams and it always comes out tender and delicious.  I've tried their regular sangria and tropical sangria and they are both good.  Their food prices are fair for dinner as well. I think sangria and mojito prices are high considering they aren't giving you alcohol but whatever.   It can get busy on a nice weekend night with the outdoor seating but the staff is very professional and friendly, minus the managers who can be rude. My biggest complain is that while I enjoy the restaurant, so does most of Montclair.  When they get crowded, the entrance of the restaurant gets jammed and almost impossible to hear the hostess as she calls out peoples names.  You end up feeling like you're in the standing room only section of a sold out concert, which isn't the way I'd chose to spend my Fri or Sat night.  Also, when they put you in the outdoor cabin during the winter, they keep the music so loud that you can't have a conversation at your table.   Good place to go, especially on a nice night, just be prepared for a lot of company.	3.0
Look: spare yourself the time and pain of reading reviews and take my word for it - if it's a nice night and you want to feel like you are on vacation, sitting outdoors with a fun, party-in-the-Carribean atmosphere, go to Cuban Pete's.  You will wait, uncomfortably, and likely for a very long time for that cool table and you will have to suffer through some God-awful service and some fairly dismal tasting, overcooked, very overpriced food, but if you can let go of all that, it can be a fun, different sort of place.  The virgin sangria is very tart and the virgin mojitos are flat and boring, so don't bother with good wine or top shelf rum.  The outdoor seating with the fun, Cuban music is the only reason to come.	2.0
was really excited to try this place for lunch after walking by it so many times.  their backyard with the  waterfall and the cuban music made me feel like i was on vacation for lunch.  unfortunately, that was about as good as it gets here, the atmosphere.  the food was mediocre at best.  the service was ridiculously piss poor.   seated for a late lunch, with not many other people in the place as it was around 2:30.   we started with  the empandas de queso.  they tasted like they came straight from the microwave .....   very mushy dough surrounding the tiniest bit of spinach and cheese.   mushy doughy mouthfuls of blandness. (the guacomole it came with was tasty, but not enough to say, "this was a good choice for an appetizer")  for lunch i had the lechon asado.   it was ok.  slightly bland for my taste not horrible.  the black beans were eh.  i enjoyed the fried plaintains.  mom had arroz con pollo.  again, serviceable, but absolutely nothing to write home about.  but the food wasnt really my gripe.  our waiter after delivering the food not ONCE came by our table afterward.  No "can i get you anything" no water refills, no soda refills.  Had to call over a manager to get our check because the stupid parking meters in Montclair only allow you 1 hr of parking on Bloomfield ave and i didnt want a ticket.   Explained to the manager that the waiter hadnt come by once during our whole meal.   he apologized, left, and then we waited another 10 minutes for our check to come.  $40 pre tip for lunch. (we each had a soda).   For mediocre food at best, and terrible service, ill skip this place next time in Montclair.  Had a much tastier and infinitesimally better service at Causual Havana in Hackensack  as well as La Isla in Hoboken.	2.0
Stars for it being a BYOB in walking distance to some Montclair night spots. There are nights when its overcrowded and you're obnoxiously standing over tables or standing in the way of waiters waiting to be seated (There are some nights that they don't take reservations). The service is mediocre and so is the food. There was a time when their credit card machine broke (no signs on the door/no message from the waiter) and we were not informed until AFTER we received the bill... had no cash/no debit card. They gave US the attitude and we sat around and had to wait for it to be up and running again. I wouldn't call this authentic either.	2.0
Not the best Cuban food I've ever had, but not the worst.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the evening.  Service was great. I had the lechon asado.  It wasn't as flavorful as I like.  It needed onions! But it was decent.  The maduros were great.  The black beans were a step above poured directly from a can. We took our own wine and ordered the "sangria."  Being from out of town, that whole situation is foreign to me.  Sangria should be made the day before so it can settle and the flavors can mesh, so adding wine right before we poured it was disappointing. Still, it's my family's favorite so I am sure I'll be back the next time I'm in NJ.	3.0
First visit was ok... I'm definitely big on food and it was ok. I ordered the stuffed clams as appetizer and the pork chops with rice and black beans for my entree. It was too salty for my tasting. The staff however was very friendly and atmosphere was nice. I'll give it another chance. Let's see. :)	2.0
Eaten here half a dozen times.  Food is average.  Crowd is pushy and loud but friendly, with lots of interplay between tables. I wouldn't suggest this place for in intimate dinner.  More suitable for a large group, particularly on weekends.  Our party was seated 30 minutes after our reservation time on a Saturday night. A nice summer evening on a weeknight changes the equation.  There is a little courtyard with maybe eight tables.   Wonderful way to spend a cool summer evening.	2.0
I went here on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner with my wife recently, and was very dissapointed. I had heard great things and was looking forward to it but it didn't live up to the hype. It was very crowded and extremely noisy. The food was just boring very bland. The staff was ok and I didn't have a problem with service. I just found it to be very gimicky and cheesy. While I was eating one of the waiters stood directly behind meand played some type of hippie drum (not a conga) it didn't sound like he was playing along to anything, and believe me the music that was playing was plenty loud. I doubt I'll ever go back there. I would recommend they worry less about the look of the place and more on how what they're serving tastes.	2.0
Every time we go here, we get tapas. You can never go wrong with that. We love the chicken lollipops and many other of the tapas. The sangria list is very good as well, but be sure to remember to bring your own wine!	5.0
This place gets 5 stars no questions asked.  The place looks nice, has great atmosphere and my meal was amazing.  It was also good enough to impress my girl who is 100% of Cuban decent, so that means something to me.  Get the Sangria too, really really good.  I can't pronounce what I got, but it was pork chops with some plantains and it was amazing.  My girl got the pulled pork, that was amazing as well.  I  am going back this coming week.	5.0
You know it's bad when you order and your food comes out 3 minutes later. This place is like Disneyworld. Actually, I have had better food there.	1.0
The food here is absolutely delicious. The Churrasco El Gaucho is perhaps one of the greatest things I've ever tasted. It's a BYOB and there are plenty of liquor stores nearby, plus they'll apparently make a great sangria for you. Great for groups, very lively place. The decor and atmosphere seem to make you forget where you are after awhile. This is as good as it gets.	5.0
One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Amazing Cuban food and amazing environment in general. Definitely recommended.	5.0
Way overrated and over priced. First of all they advertise a huge variety of sangrias. That's nice and everything but they forget to mention that they are non-alcoholic, so you have to bring your own wine and brandy and unless you know how to mix it yourself it does not taste the same. The place is usually crowded chaotic, service is subpar and slow. The food is good, but the portions are tiny and expensive compared to other Cuban restaurants which one usually leaves feeling full. I was excited and had high expectation coming here, but left disappointed sober and wanting more food. Not how one should be feeling leaving a Cuban joint.	1.0
I have been here twice and have had a good experience both times. The food is good, the place is nice and the atmosphere is lively. The staff was very nice both times. We primarily had tapas both times. The Sangria is very good as well, but it is BYOB so they do not have liquor unless you add your own. I would say it's a little too cramped if you sit up front, it's a little roomier in the back. Overall, I'd go here again.	3.0
We put our names in for a table around 5:45 on a Saturday night (they don't take reservations between 6pm-9pm). It was PACKED inside - the space that they have for waiting customers is insanely small. I informed the hostess that we would wait outside, and her response was "That's fine." After 40 minutes (and several pass-by walks by said hostess, so she knew we were sitting there) I popped in and asked how much longer the wait would be. Another hostess rolled her eyes at me (multiple times!) and said "We don't call names outside. You can put your name on the list again if you want." When I asked her why they didn't inform me of this when I TOLD THEM we would wait outside, she rolled her eyes more and repeated "We don't call names outside." We had been here once before and the food had been okay, nothing special. We'll never go here again now, nor will the people we were out to eat with, nor any of the friends we've told about this experience.	1.0
I'm surprised by the amount of negative reviews for Cuban Pete's.  Most complaints seem directed towards the service, but after having diner here tonight and enduring/resolving a potential conflict, I have to wonder what kind of service these negative reviewers feel entitled to.  Here's why Cuban Pete's is a fantastic restaurant and dining experience: Our family of six comes in on a Sunday evening to celebrate my brother's birthday, and despite the pouring rain, the place is PACKED.  (It always seems packed, which I believe signifies both its success and the concern of certain reviewers).  We are seated near a pair of speakers playing quite good, though awfully loud Latin music.  My brother has a condition making him very sensitive to loud music (we weren't previously aware of how festive and lively the restaurant is- our error).  We ask the waiter if he could turn down the music, and he does.  No problems whatsoever.  He goes on to warn the rest of the wait staff about our brother so that whenever a birthday was to be sung and celebrated they would position themselves away from the table, and they did so.   Later on in the night, the owner comes in and turns up the music.  It's his joint, and I doubt he was aware of our issue.  My father makes the universal "could you turn it down a little" face/gesture, and the owner does so without hesitation.  He comes over to our table and apologizes, makes a wonderful impression, and wishes my brother a happy birthday.  We are beaming by this point.  Twice the restaurant has gone out of its way to cater to our personal requests.  It was the kind of service that left us feeling warm and genuinely welcomed.   Before it could get any better, the owner returns with a $50 dollar gift card for my brother, saying how he knew that the full on conga drum celebration might not be his cup of tea, but that hopefully this can make up for it. It wasn't just a great dinner, it really made the night for my brother and our family.  The warmth of the owner helped to open up my brother, who usually would feel the need to leave environments that are as lively as Cuban Pete's.   I imagine that most people who have problems with Cuban Pete's have problems in general with places that are very busy.  If you don't like crowded spaces and frenetic vibes than this place may not be for you.  It is inaccurate, though, to discredit their service for an issue that boils down to personal taste.  The staff performed fantastically given the rate of their business, and as a family who experienced this exact concern first-hand, we found that speaking up politely served our needs and then some. Also, the food is great!  Most entrees cost around $14.00 and they are very generous proportions.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  The same would have easily cost double in the city.	5.0
Kind of stumbled upon this place a few years back.  It was a beautiful spring/summer evening.  My friend and I were taken away by the smell of wildflowers or something floral through the alley way before the courtyard.  First meal was a delight.  Been back almost every year since then.  The weather is getting warmer and I can't wait to go back.  I love sitting outdoors in the courtyard especially on a spring/summer night., drinking awesome Sangria (BYOB btw).  I usually order their chicken-pops w/ the mojo, goat cheese encrusted w/ almonds & honey drizzle, and a few other apps.  Their half chicken, churrasco, and bacas fritas w/ a side of maduros are worth the wait on a busy night.	5.0
After reading the great reviews here I was so excited to try this restaurant, but after experiencing it first hand i find it unbelievable that this restaurant has such great reviews.  I think people need to get out of jersey and try a good cuban restaurant in the city.  I do have a little bias since i've been dating a cuban girl for almost 10 years, and have had the chance to try a lot of cuban dishes made by her parents who were born in Cuba. I came here with a group of 9 for a birthday on a Saturday night around 8.  We knew the wait was going to be a while so we stocked up on beer to drink while we waited.  We were told the wait would be over an hour, but were seated after about 45 minutes.   We ordered a few tapas to start, the ham croquettas, papita de queso, chorizo al vino, and fried plantains.  I've never seen ham corquettas that looked like this, and they just werent good.  They were small, and you couldn't even tell ham was in there, it just tasted fried.  The papita de queso was a very similar experience, just tasted fried.  The fried plantains tasted much more like fried banana then plantains, and had a floury flavor to it.  The chorizo was pretty good, but theres not much to mess up.   As an entree I got the vaca fritas, which comes with rice, beans, and sweet plantains.  The vaca fritas was very flavorful, but so dry and chewy.  You could taste the flavor in your first few bites, but then have to chew it for another 2 minutes to get it down.  The sides were definitely the best part of the meal, and they were just ok. Many people at the table had similar experiences, with their food also being dry and chewy.   I had the tres leches for dessert and must say it was very good.  Others had the flan and said it was ok although i didn't try it. 4 people I was out to dinner with were born in Cuba, and not one person said that they had a good meal.  As one of them put it, Sophie's is better, and cheaper.	2.0
I absolutely LOVE this place! My friend first introduced me to Cuban Pete's 3 years ago and I've never had a bad experience! I am very hard to please when it comes to restaurants. I am a pretty hard critic. I love the classic pollo cubano and the steak with the chimi something sauce? Lol I forget what it's called but that has become my favorite. The wait staff are always friendly and helpful. Every time I've gone they've had a wait but it's sooooo worth it! I'm sure it's not that authentic but it sure tastes AMAZING!!!	5.0
Cuban Pete's has some of the worst customer service (from top to bottom) that I've ever experienced. The food is good, so whenever we think about going we weigh whether or not we feel up to being ignored by the hostess and waiters. Usually we're just not in the mood. And the music is insanely loud. I love latin music, but I like to have conversation with my friends at a meal more. If I wanted to feel like I was at a club, I would go to one.  Just not worth it anymore, and the food is becoming more miss than hit the last few times.	2.0
I absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is so fun especially during the summer. It's a great place to go for a night out with friends for some great food and amazing sangria (especially when you bring your own booze to add to it). Highly recommend the paella and any tapa!	5.0
So the Duo happened to have some time off and we were roaming around Montclair at lunch time  with hungry bellies. We had heard nothing but wonderful things about Petes and decided to take a shot ... Now let's get it straight, the food was very nice. We decided to order a few apps as we typically do ... garlic shrimp, empanadas, etc ... we both had their Cuban Burger ... kind of by accident actually. She wanted the burger and I actually wanted the traditional Cuban but I inadvertently ordered the same thing for the both of us ... a good mistake nonetheless. The big, huge, enormous elephant in the room was the lackluster service ... from the moment we walked in the restaurant. Hostess on her cell phone, made ZERO eye contact, not a smile, not a hello, a gruff "two?" and a shuffle towards our table ... she didn't even look at us when she sat us! As if that wasn't enough we proceeded to wait ten minutes, if not more for a server and water! NO AGUA?? NO SERVER?? Goodness gracious ... it actually took a manger who happened to walk by our table and notice our empty glasses to get us some service. I've said this before, I can be quite critical due to my involvement in the food service industry but it doesn't take a professional to be upset about these mistakes. So yes, just an "A-OK" rating for ole Petey ... And if you're wondering, the hostess never even said goodbye or even looked up as we exited the restaurant ... maybe next time ...	3.0
Next time in town, I have to try this place out when it's not 12 degrees with windchill.  The place was jumping for a wed. night.  I don't fully understand this BYOB thing in parts of NJ, but the fruit drinks etc looked great.  I'll bring a bottle of rum or tequila to give them some pep. I ordered the Oxtails and they were incredible.  Moist, juicy; perfectly done.  The plantains were exactly like I love them.  Next time I'll try the snapper!	3.0
The food here is okay. Nothing special. What I do like is the decor. It is a cute place and could be a nice date place. For the nicer seasons they also have nice outdoor seating area. We ordered a bunch of tapas dishes as appetizers and each had our own entrees. The tapas dishes included: Mini meatballs which were a tad bit over cooked and dry, Crispy pork which were not that crispy and also a tad dry, Lollipop chicken wing which was kind of tasty and a spinach empanada which was okay. Nothing special in the appetizers. On to the main course, I got the Oxtail... it actually was quite tasty... but then again I was talking about this with one of my friends.... as long as you braise it long enough and it is tender it is pretty hard to screw up oxtail. My friends seemed to enjoy their choices but from just looking at the dishes they all looked a little dry and over cooked. There are better Cuban places around. I personally would no pick this place again but wouldn't be against going to if friends wanted to go.	3.0
Cuban Pete's is really cute.  They did a great job with the decor and that's why it has 2 stars.  After that it starts to go downhill.  The place is cramped; they practically have tables on top of one another.  The service is really slow, and they don't have a liquor license so you can't drink to pass the time or forget how long the waiter took.   I have been there about 5 times and always the appetizers are really good and the entrées are just not.  I don't know what it is with them, but their entrees are overly sweet.  I had the lechon and it tasted like they put sugar or real oranges in it.  Lechon is not supposed to be sweet.  They are supposed use sour oranges (a specific type of orange that is bitter).  It's too bad because it was cooked really well, but I couldn't get past how sweet it was.  It's not that I don't enjoy sweet entrées.  I like meats with fruits or glazes.  They are just taking entrees that are not supposed to be sweet and making them sweet.  They don't taste balanced, and it doesn't compliment the other seasonings.  On another occasion, I ordered fish that was done in a coconut mango sauce, and it was extremely sweet, but I didn't mind it as much, because as least the components went well together.  I wonder if they were catering to a more American palette.   Either way, most of the entrées just don't taste Cuban and yes I am Cuban.  They take Cuban dishes and really do their own thing with them.  I wouldn't mind if the change was inspired, but it's not.   Slow waiters, cramped tables, no liquor, mostly bad entrées, yet tasty appetizers and nice decor= 2 stars.  Take an extra 10 minute ride and hit a Cuban place in Hudson County like Las Palmas or Rumba Cubana for an authentic experience.	2.0
I visit here frequently. Amazing decor and the staff and owner are super friendly and helpful. All the tapas are to die for and my fav entrees are the white fish with coconut rice (incredible) and the skirt steak!	3.0
This place is always packed and it should mean that's it excellent being that it's so popular. I do enjoy the food which brings me back every now and then for large parties. Our waiter for the first time was really nice and courteous. The hostesses are not as courteous, but I'm sure they deal with a lot of crazy customers that have to wait along a staircase to be seated, because the hostesses do not find you to seat you. You have to wait by them until your parties'  name is called or you lose your turn, which I don't get at all being that there's at least 2-3 hostesses when I've been there. It's over the top dressed up like a chain, so they might as well have those buzzers they give you to call you to the hostess stand. It would definitely help a lot.	3.0
More like a 3 1/2. So I've been to CP numerous times and always walk with the same conclusion. That it's alright and i don't understand the big  deal everyone makes it out to be. Depending on what you get your food can be simple or quite delicious. But to me what sucks the most is the service. I would probably get rid off half the waiters. I understand you work at a busy place but could you at least say your name? Or try this,"afternoon/evening everyone welcome to Cuban Petes, my name is .........................? Now that didn't take long did it? Just a crazy suggestion.	3.0
Had dinner here in the spring.  1.  food was OK.  Not great, but not bad.  2. Atmosphere was less than OK.  First, the music as LOUD!  Too loud.  One had to shout to hear the other person.  The seating was cramped and people were on top of one another.  The restaurant itself was well appointed and decorated in a Cuban flair.  3. Waiter services is s l o w.	3.0
3 years and still bad! Wow, I have been here 5 times, and it's like a bad ex you keep sleeping with. A mistake, reasons being: service is non attentive, slow and fuck up all the time. Food is a 6. and the owner just loves to kiss ur ass then take it money. He actually, wandered around and when he saw our credit card he said "oh good" and took it. Not, thank you or how was it. "oh" and the "sangeria" is either watered down or bitter. So take a date here that you secretly hate or maybe your parents if they are paying. Oh, the atmosphere is a 10, so maybe just get some plantains, and bring some wine.	1.0
Good restaurant with decent food, and hectic staff. Although the place is fairly large, with plenty of available seating, we still waited on the staircase for about 30 mins for a table. Yes, "everyone has to wait on the staircase -- let's not go there, ok?" Anyway, we were seated with one menu to share (they were running low on menus), but we figured out some appetizers before deciding on entrees. During the appetizer course, I finally got my hands on a second menu, and we ordered dinner. The food was good, a little heavy on the salt content, but good. The place is very active and loud. Not a place for an intimate date. Oh, one more thing. This is a BYOBB restaurant. They have mojito's and sangria, but the mojito's only has 5% alcohol, and the sangria does not contain any wine. Bring your own and they will incorporate into the sangria.	3.0
This place has been talked about and hyped up for a quite a while within my circle of friends.  I finally had the opportunity to check it out sometime last week.   I parked in the back, it was after 8 and there were signs all over for permit parking only.  After being screwed over in the city and other towns with tricky parking signs.. I was weary about leaving my car where I did but my hunger trumped the possibility of a ticket.  We walked through the back door where I bumped into a line of people that almost went out the door, waiting to be seated.  My girlfriends and I went down a flight of stairs to put our names down.   The wait was 20-30 minutes.. we lingered around the front and happened to get seated within less than 10 bc  when the owner was calling for parties of three and our hands shot up in the air so fast, we were practically waaaaaving at him!!   WORD OF ADVICE:  If you plan on going, super busy, so go in a party less than 4 so you don't have to wait too long. I was super excited once we sat down.   A fun atmosphere with great latin music.  ALL male waiters, dressed in yellow cuban shirts and narrow-brim panama hats.   It was great up until the waiter came by to take our order.  It was so loud that  we couldn't hear him and vice versa.  We found ourselves repeating our order several times.  There was so much on the menu and as usual I wanted everything.  For drinks, the pineapple mojito.  Not usually a fan of mojitos, but this had a great, refreshing & unique flavor.   (after I picked out the mint leaves)  It said there was 5% alcohol on the menu.   I knew this was a byob but had I known we were going to have a placebo beverage, I would've FOR SURE prepared myself with a bottle of bacardi to really spike up the drinks.  My one poor friend was feening for a drink and this was SOOOOOO not cutting it.  We ordered empanadas and papita de rellenas to start.   The taste: good but  I've had better and damn~~ were they small.  I'm used to ordering appetizers where by the time I finish them, I calm down a bit (I get quite cranky when I'm hungry)  A bite and half.  I could've gone to CostCo's on a Saturday and been more satisfied.   I asked our waiter for his recommendation on what is the best on the menu.  He suggested the churrasco.  Looked amazing when it came out, but for something that was supposed to be med. rare, it was more like medium well.   the steak was dry and did not go down smoothly.   I really wanted to like this place but  was too loud & most importantly the food was really not up to par.  the sister restaurant, Rumba Cubana located in North Bergen.... waaaaaaaaay better far and beyond!  My first and last trip to Cuban Pete's.	1.0
This place has it's bad and good parts...but mostly good! I don't like the standing around by the stairs waiting to be seated while bus boys and waiters are passing by you and don't like the very tiny tapas(appetizers). But the atmosphere and decor completely help with those upsets. The food and drinks are very good...especially the mojitos! I totally recommend the honey dew mojitos.	3.0
So, So food.  Poor service. Sangria was not good. I went there the other day with a group of 9 for a going away get together.  I had heard that the food was good and so was the sangria. Unfortunately, the food was ok (I have had better Tapas in North Bergen), and the sangria was terrible.  Its a BYO, so I know that going in but I just had hopes that the sangria would be better.  But now that I think about it how could it?  I brought the red wine, but sangria is more than wine (triple sec, apple pucker, etc) and they didn't have that. Fortunately, the company was good otherwise I would have been really upset. I wouldn't go back.  There are other places where you'll get better service, real sangria, and the food will be better too.	1.0
More style than substance......restaurant has a terrific outdoor patio....rather.... it could be a terrific outdoor patio if I could hear what was being said at our table.  The music was cranked up so the conversations went something like this...."What?  Could you repeat that?  Excuse me?"  The food was ok.....but could not be enjoyed....left with a headache.	3.0
I'm not much of a Cuban-food person, but for what they have, it is yummy. The outdoor seating is in a cute little courtyard.	3.0
OK. Ok.. beeg man.. wanna make some beeg bucks...   You know something about cuban food?  Diga me!  There's a Cuban Restaurant in Montclair.. new guys.. said they've got two entrees... pure stuff.  If it is what they say its, you buy it and you bring it back.  Oh... and if anytheeng hapeens to the money.... pobrecito.. you're going to loose some stars. I liked my meal.  I really dug the ox tails.  They fell right off the bone.  The beans and rice were delicious.  The atmosphere is a "good for groups" place.  (Read: very loud).  The setting is very creatively designed.  My wife's meal was very forgettable... but the ox tails almost made up for that.. Here's where the deal went wrong and I had to pull out the chainsaw.  The Mojito mix.  You buy your "mixers" there, either sangria or several flavors.  You add your rum / wine / lighter fluid / antifreeze.  The mojito mix was kind of bad actually.  I expected big things for a pitcher of mixer that was over $12.  It just tasted like sour mix or something.  I didn't really enjoy my drink.  And I'm a raging alcoholic! All in all, it's a great place for a group dinner.  Get the ox tails.  I'll go back to test the sangria and see if that's a better option.	3.0
Decided to have lunch after reading some of the reviews. The first thing I noticed was the awkward entrance. The place was moderately busy and the music loud. I noticed that all the waiters were dressed the same-yellow shirt with straw hats even  if the fit was big :) and they seemed in a rush. No time for basic pleasantries. The food was tasteless and looked like it was thrown on a plate. Caribbean people are known to be warm, happy  & hospitable - their food tasty, flavorful and feast full to the eye- they failed on both.	1.0
I've walked past this place several times and the decor, music, and outdoor seating area have caught my eye.  My boyfriend and I decided to check it out this past Friday evening before a comedy show at the Wellmont. The decor inside is very "cute" - the colors and decor to make you have that Caribbean feel.  Cuban music through the speakers - which was way too loud.  The loud music lead to people around you practically screaming to have a conversation.  Music would have been fine had the volume been turned down a bit so people could hear themselves thing. We ordered the empanadas which were tasty but SMALL.  We got three chicken empanadas for the appetizers which were mostly dough.  Would not order those again as I felt it was a bit of a rip off. For dinner my boyfriend got the Picadillo which was plentiful and delicious.  I got the Chicken cuban sandwich with avocado and cilantro pesto was very tasty. Food came very quickly - felt a bit rushed although service was attentive.   Our table was wobbly and it seemed like it was up to use to stick a napkin under the leg to keep it from shifting.  Wasn't until our check came that the matre'd  saw what we did and had one of the waitstaff fix it with a wooden wedge. Bottom line - Cuban Pete's is a yes for delicious Cuban food - however don't expect to have a quiet meal nor expect to have a leisurely one either.	3.0
Cuban Pete's for me had it's fair share of highs and lows. So let's start with the lows. Low's: - Decibel levels that rival the sound system at Webster Hall. - Lighting is really dim. I like to see if my plate has any pubes. - Portions can be better. All the "authentic/hardcore" spanish places i've been to served enough food for two people but was priced for one. - Again, the price could've been better....for cuban cuisine. - Crowded as hell! no reservations on Saturday's. Luckily, we went on a Friday. High's: - The chimichurri sauce was one of the best that i've tasted. I've not found many places that make this sauce properly. - The rice was awesome! - It's BYOB. - The restaurant decor & set-up was cool. I was diggin' the outside seating also, which would be cool in the summer. - Talent all over the place. - Good music. Although it was loud as shit. A few other observations: -The waiters were all cuban, with the whole cuban outfit get-up, & decent service. - Skirt steak was pretty good. Small portion. I had better. - The beans were pretty good. I had better. - The chorizo was good. I had better. So my overall experience was pretty good. We had a party of 7 and it seemed like everyone had a good time. Hugo, Ricardo, & Jorge!....Until next time....	3.0
Have heard a lot about this restaurant and finally gave it a try. We went with another couple who has been a couple of times. We went on a Thursday and they were very busy which shows how popular they are. Once we got sat we had to wait probably about 15-20 minutes before we ever saw our waiter. Well, we saw him pass us many times, but never stopped. The attentiveness of the waiter was pretty much nonexistent until it was time for the check. We had to call over random people to get more drinks etc. When it came to the bill, he couldn't give it to us fast enough. It is a BYOB and we brought wine to make sangria. I am not sure how they make thier sangria, but the pitcher is practically full before any wine even enters it. We made 3 pitchers with 1 standard bottle of wine. I wouldnt recommend doing the sangria route unless they let you do the whole thing. We had pitchers of white and red and both were the same way. (the fruit in the white didn't look ripe, was hard to tell in the red). The decor is very cuban, the waiters fit the bill, and there is cuban music etc (a little loud) but the whole thing worked. We had the bacon wrapped dates and empanadas to start and I had the pulled beef, my wife had the white fish with mangoish stuff on it and the other couple had suckling pig and something else i cant remember. All of the food was very good. I also forgot my favorite part. We had some food we wanted to take home. When we asked to have it wrapped up we were asked if it would be easier for us to do it or him to do it. I've never heard that one before. He decided it would be easier for us to do it. Very interesting tact. There is on street parking and a lot in the back (rare in montclair in this area). I would probably go again, but the sangria situation is pretty disappointing.	3.0
Food was great, but wait-staff was terrible.  They didn't refill our drinks, check on us, and we had to flag them down for re-fills and the check as they buzzed by waiting on other people.	3.0
Nice place. Not the place to go on an intimate date, but a friendly place to go with a positive upbeat atmospere. The service was good. The Sangria is yummy as is the food. I had the Bahama Coconut fish and some appetizers. They were very good. I'm sure in the spring eatting outdoors is fun. Its decor is very appealing and cute as well.	3.0
Went here on a Sunday evening with my husband.  Just to make this review short and sweet, i'll stick to bullets. decor-cute and tropical.  think miami. food-Ive had much better cuban food in HUDSON county. sangria-this place is byob.  their sangria with our bottles was BLAH.  not worth the $14.95 service-was great!  he had no problem sending back my appetizer since it came out kinda chilled.   would i go back?  nope.  i think people that say this place is 5stars must not really  know what cuban food is.  again, the ambiance is sweet.  the bday bongos is swell, but im here to eat good food damn it!  and this my friends, was meh.   go somewhere else guys.  try North Bergen or Union City NJ for the real deal.	2.0
As a first generation Cuban-American I've been to my share of Cuban restaurants in the tri-state area. I'm always alert when a Cuban restaurant has a non-Cuban owner, and it's somewhat justified here. This place is known for it's ambiance and presentation and doesn't disappoint here. Lushly decorated and secluded outdoor seating in the open air makes for a fantastic date experience in the summer. When it comes to the actual food, it's hit or miss. On the miss days, it's quite apparent that the 2nd string chef didn't grow up on the stuff and it all turns out a bit bland. Good place to bring non-Cuban friends or non-Cuban dates. Otherwise, hit up the real stuff. NOTE: Their sangria is NON ALCOHOLIC! Don't be fooled, it's virgin, but they will put a bottle of red in a pitcher for you if you bring it.	3.0
i always give good review whenever a restaurant is BOYB.  They have pitchers of mojito and sangria you can mix your wine with.  Great idea.  This is definitely a young crowd since theres plenty of outdoor seatings just an overall LOUD atmosphere.   The braised beef is GOOD and it came in large portions.  Everything else (chicken,  ropa vieja, steak) was ok.  Parking is not so bad but this isn't manhattan so i don't expect to walk a few blocks. The food is not very authentic but still decent.	3.0
I kindof love this place but in like an embarassing way... I have no idea how "authentic" the Cuban food is, but it is delicious, the service is ok, and the atmosphere is really fun - like going to a Disney World theme restaurant. Definitely make a reservation if you want a good or outdoor table in the summer though, any night of the week, because it can get pretty busy being so festive (and people love to have birthdays there.) Oh yea, it's loud. The sangria is good but it's bring your own if you actually want it with any alcohol. There are a bunch of good tapas options - I especially love these little pistachio, goat cheese balls they have warmed in honey. I always order the Vaca Frita (crispy, shredded beef that comes with rice, beans, and plantains). So crispy, so tasty, so filling (this is where being a fake vegetarian gets me into trouble). If you have room for dessert, the three milk cake is a winner. Eat, drink, and be Cuban! In Montclair, NJ!	3.0
Came here for friend's birthday. The mojitos and sangrias were great. I ordered the red snapper with rice and plantain and it was good. My bf had the braised oxtail with rice. His food was ok. We had better oxtail elsewhere. Anyways, the atmosphere was great and we all had a great time. Even though the waiter had a bit of an attitude and some of our food came about 20 minutes later than everyone else's, I would still come back.	3.0
Saw this on the loading page and got the urge to chime in on my experience here.  Hm...where to start...located on bloomfield avenue, i had always passed by this place and saw crowds of people seated inside and outside.  So when my friend suggested Cuban Pette's, I was elated, as in mouth watering at the thought of good food.  Well...maybe it was the high expectations from the crowd...quite misleading, i must say.  I can't remember what dish I had but the food were all - TOO SALTY! those with hypertension is advised against going.  Even the seafood had that seafoody taste, that just makes it unpleasant.	1.0
Great decor & atmosphere are the best things you can say about Cuban Pete's. The food has really slipped since it first opened and the service is impossibly slow and indefferent. It's still a fun place, but don't go there thinking you're going to get a good Cuban meal or you'll be dissapointed.	2.0
The best thing about Cuban Pete's is the atmosphere and sangria. During the summer the outdoor seating is really fantastic. Unfortunately, the food is not fantastic -- I have been there 3 times and every time had overly dry cuban sandwiches, or oily, bland entrees.	3.0
It is OK.  The ambience makes up for a lot.  Definitely try to get seating outside, as it is TOO LOUD inside to enjoy a meal.  The Sangria and Mojitos DO NOT contain alcohol, don't be fooled by the price.  The food is tastey but very pricey.  Although we have had some terrible service here, there was one waiter in particular that was excellent.  He made terrific recommendations and would not allow us to order anything that he felt was subpar that day.  Go for the atmosphere, order the lamb lollipops and some paella, and wave to the dog that usually looks down from above waiting for the manager to throw him a bone.	3.0
Went with a group of seven ladies.  Out of the seven of us, only one even enjoyed their food.  And it's overpriced!  (Also, there is hardly anything vegetarian on the menu) The service was horrible.  People didn't get the things they ordered, whole appetizers were forgotten.   The only good thing I can say about this place is it has a great (albeit loud) atmosphere.	1.0
I loved the ambiance of Cuban Pete's. You must walk down a boardwalk with palm trees and coconuts strewn which takes you out of Montclair, NJ straight to Cuba. The scenery excited me but I was soon met with disappointment. Getting a seat was challenging as the hostess was distracted and seemed to ignore my group until I spoke up and told her we would need a table for 3. Once seated, we watched waiters whizz by as quickly as possible but no one came to greet the table for 15 minutes. The waiter was nice but he missed one of our appetizers. Admittedly, it could have been poor communication on our side.  The food seemed to take forever to come out. When we were told they were almost done, I made a comment that it was taking a long time. The waiter told us that we ordered appetizers that took longer as if it were my fault. I'm curious if we also ordered entrees that were challenging for the kitchen as much time had passed before we saw our plates. And I must stress, our plates... We watched as three other tables (who were sat after we placed the order) receive their food. The meal was delicious but over priced. It would have been ok if the service was better. I probably won't go there again.	2.0
Went here on a Saturday night- too packed for my taste. The wait was anywhere between 45min - 1hour wait IF you were a party of 2, thank Buddha we were a party of 4 = immediate seating. They don't take reservations on parties less than 6 people, I thought that kind of sucked. My friend & I (amongst other guests) almost busted our backs by slipping on what seemed to be spilled water...the hostess saw this, the person seating saw this, the wait staff saw this- no one bothered to address the issue = I smell a lawsuit, people. I think the wait staff is spread too thinly for the amount of people eating. Our waiter was running around like a chicken w/out a head. I think the concept of BYOB is tacky, mostly for an establishment that seems to be a little bit more than just casual, but that's just my personal preference. My friend loves the concept, however we felt, like other reviewers, that the prices for the beverages were a little over-priced; the sangria in particular, moreso if you're left to possibly bring your own wine to mix in. The food was quite tasty...the prices were *eh*, I guess you're paying for the whole 'Cuban' experience. Would I go back? Maaaaaybe, if it was someone's b-day & that was their #1 choice.	3.0
i was so excited to check out cuban pete's because the patio looked awesome. unfortunately, the food was mediocre and my mojito tasted like lemonade. our waiter was nice enough, but very slow considering the place was half empty. *beware vegetarians. usually i can find something at any place to eat, but almost everything had meat. the only alternatives here are tapas that are cheese based :-(	2.0
I thought the service was good but that's about it. The waiter was friendly and patient with  one of our friends from Italy  who speaks little to no English. We ordered a pitcher of their version of a mojito which was watered down and tasteless. Then we tried their sangria which was worse then the mojito. That sangria was the worst sangria I have ever had in my life. Then I had ropa vieja  which is a very basic Cuban dish which was extremely bland.  Skip this place it was a tasteless experience  and try a Cuban restaurant with authentic food and drinks.	2.0
Cuban Petes has lost its edge	2.0
We used to love this place. Then, they changed owners and it went downhill.  We come here mostly for tapas, but have had meals as well.  Be aware that they do not have a liquor license and when you order sangria, you're essentially getting grape juice with fruit.  They do not advertise this and many first timers are disappointed. You can BYOB and they'll make you sangria, if you choose.  Overall, the food is ok, but given that it's Montclair, I'd go elsewhere as there is no shortage of food around here.	3.0
I love Cuban Pete's ....I love even the cheesy decor and the waiter's hats. but please stop trying to fool us with your sangria...i dont want it without some alcohol...am I admitting to some alcoholic tendencies? I dont know, but when I think sangria, I dont think just fruit juice...there has to be a nice buzz that accompanies splitting a pitcher. Am I right? I know this place is BYO, so definitely BYO if you are planning on having the sangria....	3.0
Good atmosphere outside but once you walk in, it takes a turn for the worse. The food is not authentic as they claim to be. It's bland and below average. My good friends mom is Cuban and to me, that's authentic. The wait staff was attentive but the main guy who I think owns this place wasn't at all friendly.	2.0
I went to Cuban Pete's for my cousin's 24th birthday dinner and it was just a mess. Our party had 20 people but as most dinner parties go people don't come at the same time. When my cousin arrived we had 9 people sitting at the table (I'll admit we were an hour late for our reservation but there were 3 people at the table since 8). There was only one menu there. We asked for more menus so we could get appetizers. The waiter told us that he could not give more menus until the whole party was there or they would give him problems. He ended up bringing them anyway. Two more people showed up and we ordered mojitos..that tasted horrible because there is .5% alcohol in them (note the point before the 5) because they "wait for the fruit to naturally ferment". At that point (9:30) everyone was really hungry but he kept asking us if we'd be having more people and because we were he did not take appetizer orders. Finally at 10 he took our orders. When he brought out appetizers oddly enough two of the orders never came. Some of the food came at 11:15! Some people had to leave and cancel their orders because it took so long. And once again 2 orders (including the birthday girl's) did not come. She asked for her food again and found it to be tough and asked them to send it back for the delicious paella. At that point we were all packing up to leave (11:45) so we couldn't even sit and enjoy our food. Plus my cousin never got her happy birthday! We complained to the manager and his answer is that HE KNEW we had bad service and that our waiter was really bad. That he WAS WATCHING our table the whole time and getting upset with our service (nevertheless he never came and asked how the service was even though he was watching). And his solution was that we NOT PAY THE GRATUITY. Not to get my cousin's meal for free or to get a percentage off the bill but to not pay the one waiter that was waiting on our party of 20 and 3 OTHER tables. How UNPROFESSIONAL! Of course we worked out what we wanted and everyone got dessert. But then he mentioned the fact that most of the dinner party came late and that he lost business because they had to wait for us so long(even though we had to wait 30-45 to just get menus). We still tipped the guy because we realized how much of an asshole the manager was. But I will never come back here again!	1.0
I have been here a couple times. They have a great atmosphere, I mean really great... so great that you don't really notice much else. While you are busy having fun, they serve some pretty good food and nice sangria. The waitstaff is nice, but sometimes there is quite a wait and they can get very busy. It's fun and I'd go back, but if I'm dying for really good latin food, it's gotta be El Unico in Weehawken.	3.0
Pete's is great. I have only eaten here once, but I found the food to be delicious, and the ambiance to be quite enjoyable. The decor is fantastic -- the outdoor patio is beautifully decorated, and indoors you feel like you're on vacation, rather than Bloomfield Ave. The location is prime. The food is very good, prices decent, table service was good, wait staff was friendly. I ordered fish - and they brought it whole, and I had to debone the whole thing before digging in. That kind of grossed me out, but I know that that's part of Cuban Pete's rustic vibe. Other than that, my friends' dishes were also good and our sides were good. The only reason I didn't give more stars is because I am just not into this kind of cuisine, but I still wanted to try it. This place came highly recommended to me, and I would recommend it to others looking for something new, exciting, and delicious!	3.0
Ok so let me start off by saying I understand why people like Cuban Pete's.  The atmosphere is great, the outdoor dining is an experience and the food is good. My problem with Cuban Pete's is their lack of professionalism and the restaurant is a fire or accident waiting to happen. I will admit to being a klutz...I am...I fell outside of Cuban Pete's and cut my knee and it was bleeding a lot.  We walk into Cuban Pete's I go into the bathroom to wash my knee, one of my friends asks the hostess if they have a 1st aid kit so she can have a band aid- she is told to hold on.  Another woman in the bathroom sees me cleaning off my cut and is like wow you need alcohol and a band aid - let me go ask someone. So she goes and asks...soon the owner, Pete, comes into the ladies bathroom and asks me what the problem is and I say oh I just need a band aid and some alcohol swipes do you have a 1st aid kit.  This man tells me "no we don't have any of that"  and I ask...wait so your a restaurant with cooks handling food and knives and servers handling plates what do you do when someone gets cut?   He says to me and I quote "We're Cubans we don't need that!"  And I think to myself..in other words you let our cooks put their bloody hands in the food..great.  So I continue to clean my cut...one of my friends walks to the Subway a couple of doors down to get a band aid.   So after all this there is about a 30 min. wait...the place is packed...they do not have a waiting area so everyone is huddled around the hostess area and up and down the stairs waiting.  Meanwhile servers are passing by thru the small area and up and down the stairs with hot food (the floor is also wet by the way)  I was waiting for someone to get hit in the face with a plate of hot food. Ok so we are seated outside, which I stated before is nice.  So I lost my appetite after the whole band aid convo with Pete so I order something very small and simple and a drink...my friends order something that sounded delicious. We get our food after about waiting about 45-1 hour for it to come out (there are 3 of us)  We eat and pick at each others food and its decent.  Not great..I have had better Cuban food..but its good. So the area outside is small and does not leave too much space in between tables for the servers to walk. As we are waiting for the check a busboy passes by with a bucket of water (for what in the middle of a very busy time - I have no clue) he bumps into something and drops the WHOLE bucket of water all over one of my friends.  She is completely drenched as if she got caught in a monsoon.  Does he say sorry and offer any help??? NO! He looks at our table all confused and walks away.  No one comes back with anything for her to dry off.  So we start using the napkins on the table...other patrons sitting next to us start to give us their napkins as well.   At this point I am pissed off - So I walk to the hostess and ask for Pete or some manager.  A manager or Pete (cant remember which one) walks over to the table..and I give him a great what for as my friend is ringing water out of her shirt. So he says he is sorry..comps our meal (only because I told him I refused to pay for anything) and walks away. That was last summer - I don't know if they got any better or bigger (doesn't look like it though) but I will never EVER go back to that establishment again.	2.0
Cuban Pete's in Montclair is a great find. The tapas were small tastes of heaven-especially the masitas de puerco (pork tenderloins) were amazing.  The desert which I ordered two-churros and the flan, OMG they melted in your mouth.  I have purposely not mentioned the service and the sangrias which quite frankly sucked.  The sangria tasted like old wine and not sweet- and the service was horrible. Its worth a trip back and hopefully the service will get better with time.	3.0
Let me first state that the waitstaff at this italian BYOB was very attentive and very good at their jobs.    That said, the reason we went to this restaurant was the recommendation of the food.   I had a veal saltimbocca, my wife had a stuffed chicken and veal dish in a "light" italian vinegrette, and we split a ceasar salad.   First - the Ceasar salad tasted like dishwater.   In fact, since we were very hungry and the presentation was nice, we ate the salad, but I think it was a mistake.   We had to ask for extra anchovies to cover up the taste!     Next my wife's dish was WAY overcooked.   The chicken was so overcooked, she couldn't cut it with the knife they gave us.  I picked it up and actually thumped the chicken on her dish!    In addition, the "light vinegrette" was an overpowering balsamic vinegar that we both tasted for an hour after the meal (and I had one bite!).     Last, salt was the operative word in my veal Saltimbocca.   Again, so badly salty that I couldn't taste the rest of the dish.   After we both took a few bites and said enough, the waitress came over to our table.   She knew the dinners had problems (and I think even before we recieved them she knew) as she immediately offered to buy us dinner.   I do have to say, we ate for free (except for the tip), but what we ate was terrible.   I might go back and try the pasta (which they are supposed to be known for as well), but everytime I think about that dinner, I think it is probably one of the WORST meals I've ever had and I change my mind.	1.0
I purchased one roll of paper towels from Forrest dairy for. $2.28  on  Saturday Nov 26 2011. I paid an additional .16 cents sales tax  I know .16 cents is not much money, but consider over a year period all the customers being charged sales tax Om paper products which new jersey taxation states stores cannot charge sales tax on paper products. I Am sure the owner or owners are aware of this law but choose to ignore it as long as the customers say nothing. Convenience stores charge extra as it is because of being  open most of the time I understand that but this is blatant theft. Ps. I don't know about anyone else but I feel I pay enough taxes in rutherford they should at the very least see that the residents aren't being ripped off. I checked the two other stores. Mini mart. And krausers  same thing they are getting away with charging    sales tax on paper products. It's being greedy	1.0
Only a few cars in lot, plenty of open tables, and we're offered a seat at the bar!  Really?!  Stopped by once before and thought the place was pretentious. Now I'm sure.  I won't return and predict they won't be here for long anyway.	1.0
Service was great but the food was hit or miss. The Italian nachos had a decent flavor and was our favorite. But the sad part was getting some over cooked seafood. Everything else was mediocre. I might go back for happy hour for the nachos and maybe try something else. But it's a big maybe.	3.0
Went to PJ Rufos to mix it up a bit. The food and menu is all well prepared.  The ingredients are quality, preparation is nice.  However, I didn't find anything remarkable or inspiring.   I was a little frustrated that even though the menu says all entrees come with vegetable & potato, mine (shrimp & beans) came with neither.  My other pet peeve was that a vegetarian in our group ordered a salad that said nothing on the menu about being sprinkled with meat... when it came out she was surprised and had to send it back.  I'd be worried going here with someone with severe dietary restrictions. The space is divided into a dining room and bar, but from most of the dining room you can see the TVs.  This kind of makes it hard to have a quiet, romantic, evening.   What I find the most frustrating was the service was awful.  Distracted, unhelpful & robotic.  For the price of our meal, I expected a LOT more. Overall, I can't see going back to this place -- with all the other choices for good italian food in the area.	2.0
I dined at this restaurant back in the summer of 07 so MAYBE things have changed based on the few reviews but I still want to give you an idea of how this place was in 07 which i believe was when they added a dining room area(otherwise why would you have a dining area walled in directly across from a large bar?)  Since it's been 4 yrs I don't remember exactly what we ate but do remember the experience. First off made an 830p reservation we arrived a few minutes early when the owner(?) greeted us he said something to the effect "oh, the 845p reservation arrived early & asked if they could be seated early" so i said "so, you bypassed an EARLIER reservation who was ON TIME???"  so by the time i put something to eat in my mouth it was almost 930p & by the time we left it was after 1130p he said "you'll be next" not even offering a free drink or something to munch on during out wait(which we had to wind up standing because the bar was packed) we did a "2-for" drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts--nothing was memorable, service was at best slow(maybe because they just got into this part of the business but not giving a pass either) & total tab with tax/tip came to $125 & that was AFTER decucting a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate so definitely overpriced. I prefer to give a detailed rating as opposed to just saying I liked it or I didn't. For me I rate a restaurant in 4 categories in order of importance: Food Service Value Décor/ambience/misc If you're wondering why this is the order for me I rather have great food & so-so service than the other way around.  You can always plan around a slower evening to make it just as enjoyable but not around mediocre food whether it's fast or slow paced. My 3rd item I call value instead of price because based on the taste & serving portion of the item compared to similar items at other restaurants tells me if it's a good value.  For instance the best steak I've ever had to date runs about $44 but besides being delicious(a way to tell is it stands on its own w/o adding any sauces) it is boneless & about 24oz so you get two good meals. Food(2.0), service(1.5), value(1.0) & décor/ambience/misc(0.5) I then take the # stars for each category & multiply by the # in parentheses then divide by 5 to get my final rating. If the final average is exactly 1/2 I'll round up or down depending on other reviews. So my calculations are as follows: FOOD                                     2 x 2 = 4.0 SERVICE                               1 x 1.5 = 1.5 VALUE                                   0 x 1 =   0 AMBIENCE/OTHER             1.0 x .5 = 1.0 Total pts 6.5 divided by 5 = 1.2 which rounds to 1	1.0
It's average Italian food. I've had the Putanusca and the Carbonara. Both were average but the carbonara was very watery. Wouldn't go outta my way to get to this place.	3.0
There is nothing really amazing or memorable or shockingly good here....it is a nice Italian restaurant in a suburban strip mall. Nothing to distinguish it from a jillion other such places, except: Everything is done right here, in a detail oriented way such that I cannot think of one thing wrong or badly done or worthy of criticism. When people really care, it shows. Have the tortellini.....delicious!	3.0
They have half price rolls, when they first opened their hand rolls were really nice, as time passes they're getting smaller and smaller, I understand they're running a special but not good to be inconsistent especially if you're trying to get customers...	2.0
I came here the day of the grand opening.  Aside from the menu, not much of the restaurant itself has changed from the previous restaurant.  For a grand opening the place was pretty dead when we arrived.  However, not too long after we started eating a few more groups of people started to come in.  I also noticed that there were speakers for background music, but no background music which made it feel like there was a lack of privacy since everyone could hear our entire conversation. I Got the Bento Box B, which came with steak teriyaki. The steak teriyaki was very good and was cooked perfect, and when I mean perfect, I mean medium.  The Shrimp and vegetable tempura were delicious and were also cooked perfectly.  The sushi inside the bento box also tasted great. Being that it was the first night I'm sure they had a few kinks to work out and maybe the sound system wasn't working right.  Since everything tasted great I'm going to have to come back for a second try.	3.0
Just went to a bday party in the room downstairs and had a great time! The food was really good, my favorite was the paella! The decor fits in perfectly with the name. I'm coming back for dinner! The waiters were ok, they weren't as attentive and I needed to grab their attention a few times.	3.0
Just had lunch with my fellow yelper Yoli, where do I begin. We had the garlic shrimp for an appy and although it was a decent size for two people is was over cooked and tasted hard and chewy. I had the daily special chicken with mushrooms, Yoli had ordered twin lobster tails. My chicken was also over cooked tasted like s#%t! Her twin tails ended up being a whole broiled lobster!which guess again....was over cooked, tasted like rubber... lol.   Needless to say the whole meal was a lost cause except for the sangria which was actually good. The buzz factor was pretty good for a single pitcher. The restaurant itself seemed a bit outdated. The bar was full of old guys sipping beer watching soccer. The seats at the tables were like sitting on a rock, my butt was killing me by the end of the meal. Judging by other reviews it's seems this place is hit or miss, with such a wide variety of restaurants in the Ironbound I would skip this place.	2.0
I've been here a few times, mostly just for drinks. They have great prices on beer. I did order a dish once and didn't realize it was going to be such a huge serving. The food was delicious and definitely worth the price. The bartenders are very friendly. I really like the staff there, I've even gone back on my own just to have a drink and chat it up with them.	3.0
The titanic has SUNK !!!!! Don't go here looking for treasures , your will only find crap. This place is bad . There are many many places in Ironbound ( I live here) and this isn't one of them.	1.0
I kind of like this place. Evertime I go here I am the only white guy surrounded by Portuguese dudes and families. Their fish is good and their espresso is the best in Newark. Nice change from the larger places that dominate the area.	3.0
This Portuguese restaurant was pretty forgettable, the paella was meh with the service to match.  Won't be going again.	2.0
We went there once after the Red Bulls game with more than 30 people and had the entire upstairs.  There was a dispute as they wanted to charge us $20+ per person for paella even for the kids.  We ended up staying for a lower price and upon our next visit they would take care of us, which they did.	2.0
The decor was ok. It kinda resembled a ship hence the name Titanic. Anyways, the service was decent and I enjoyed the calamari and my stuffed salmon entree. The place wasn't crowded which was ok but sometimes when a place is not crowded or even barely half full, you begin to wonder. Hmmm....? Anyways, this place is "A-OK!"	3.0
Just don't waste your time. Went there with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. As we waited for our entrees, a MOUSE ran by my feet and into the wall behind me. Enough said. Waiter was nice. Place was in need of a major renovation.	1.0
While I was really hoping this would be a great place to get Mexican Food.  I was very disappointed.  I grew up eating great Mexican dishes so when I read these ratings I thought it would be great.  I thought it would be a diamond in the rough.  Sad to say, it was worse than Taco Bell if that's possible.  When you read things like "authentic" that's what you expect!  Unfortunately there was nothing authentic about the stadium cheese sauce they put on their nachos.  Is fresh shredded cheese too much to ask for.  Is anyone tasting the food.  There is absolutely no flavor. I hope something will change.  I want them to be successful.  I truly do.	1.0
I eat 3 meals a day out for the last 25+ years, so I know good food. The hype on this place is incomprehensible. There is no flavor....at all.  I've eaten here since the first week they opened approximately 10-12times.  I've also eaten at their Hamilton location.  Same.  ZERO flavor.  Both locations are consisteny. Their hottest sala is MILD!!!!!!!!!!  I think they call it volcano. I'm easy to please, so service isn't a deal-braker for me, but I'll let you decide on this aspect. I REALLY wanted to like this place:  Family run, small business. In all honesty, Taco Bell tastes better.   The day they address the lack of flavor, I will eat here a minimum of 2 x a week. I really hate to give this review, but it's fair and honest.	2.0
I like the pork burritos here, but the food and service are very inconsistent.  When they good, they're quite good, but if you hit this place on an off day, it's pretty lackluster.	3.0
Generally sad.  Made for an unknowing customer.  Greasy chips.  Nondescript salsa.  A cut about Taco Bell.  Seriously the place needs help in the kitchen.	1.0
They give you your money's worth. I had the speedy Gonzales special of grilled chicken, peppers, onions, cheese, rice, beans, avocado & tortillas. Generous portion plus canned soda for about $10. It just wasn't very tasty & reminded me that as person born in Texas, Mexican food in NJ or PA is rarely to my taste. There was a steady stream of people picking up orders. I'm glad the place is doing well,  just not for me.	2.0
Decent place to eat that breaks the norm for us. Pros: cute, well branded, smells wonderful, the homemade tortilla chips and the mild salsa is literally the best salsa I've ever tasted. Staff is EXTREMELY friendly. Impossible cake is so so yummy. We received a free sample. You also get free chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Cons: small/cramped, no waiter service, plastic plates/utensils, only cans of soda and bottled water, all food is pre-prepared and nuked when you order it (you can hear the microwave). Music is kind of loud to the point where the bass rings in your ears. The food is definitely tasty but it would be a million times better if they made it fresh to order. Wish there was a fountain for drinks and real plates & utensils. This food might be better enjoyed as takeout. I'm on a mission to get some of the mild salsa and chips to go. We aren't local. I can't see us making the hour trip just to come back, but if we did, it's for the salsa and impossible cake!	3.0
The girl in front was awesome and attentive.   There were one man waiting for a togo order and one couple.  It should have been a sign to leave when alot of items on the menu where crossed out. I ordered the carne asada meal and a tres leche. They were out of the tres leche. So i wait and wait and wait and my food is finally ready. I get home and open my container and tortillas. The tortillas look like the ones out a taco store bought package. I taste the beans and promptly spit them out. They were horrible!!!! Tried the rice, no good. So i start on my meat. First off ive never had carne asada where the beef is already cut into slices. Tastes over cooked and waaaaaay too much pepper. Honestly i through it away. Maybe im just spoiled bc. I live in virginia ans have millions of spanish food places, but i will not be going back to this place. Sorry guys	2.0
"Hi Jerry, we're very sorry that your experience wasn't up to either of our expectations." SERIOUSLY ???? Not up to EITHER of our expectations ??? The last time I looked, you got paid, IN FULL, and I got CRAP for lunch. I'd say that for your statement to be true, you would've received the same thing I got. pennies on the dollar. I was out $24, and we left your food in your trash bin. EVEN ? I Think Not.  YOU would've been run OUT of Chicago.	1.0
Well, the service and the quality were sorely lacking here tonight.  We ordered 2 nachos and 1 carne asada.  We got the carne asada and one nacho.  When I asked if they had forgotten the other one, I was met with total incomprehension, a smile and a nod.  I reminded the person who had taken my order that I was due another order of nachos and she said they were coming and called the next person to pick up their order.  I explained that the entire order should have come together and she just blinked at me. So, hen I attempt to et my carne asada and the meat is tough and nearly impossible to chew. When they first opened the service was much better be he food palatable. Skip this place.	1.0
Was craving a quesadilla today, but decided to order the Mariachi Plate for some variety, and I'm kind of pissed that I did. Sure, everything was executed well, but the lack of their including any sauce/salsa left me with a dry mess in my tummy. Nothing was zippy or spicy on its own, and I had no means of adding any oomph in that department, so needless to say it was a very boring meal. Next time I'll order the quesadilla and request extra salsa so I at least get something out of the deal. Meh.	2.0
I haven't tried the dessert  but I did have a steak burrito (which was pretty good), a soup (also decent), and their chips and salsa (blah). Also I asked for the spiciest sauce and it was weaker than those packets of "fire" taco bell hands out. Kind of sad. I would even rather drive the extra miles to On the Border on Rt. 1...just for their chips and salsa & guac. It wasn't BAD...but it wasn't memorable either and I would never waste money there again...except maybe to try these Tres Leches everyone's raving about.	3.0
Honestly I have mixed feelings about this place. Some dishes are great, others are simply not that exciting. The chicken burrito was very filling but lacked spice/cilantro etc. I recommend the beef tacos, comes with guac which makes it perfect. Complete with beans and rice. Chips are meh. When choosing salsa, do not be afraid of the labeling, the volcano salsa is perfect even though they consider it to be extremely spicy ---not the case.	3.0
Not spicy, I would prefer taco bell to this	2.0
I love Mexican food. I was excited to try this new place close to home.  Very disappointing.  Mixed reactions. Staff super friendly. I got take out very late.  They made no complaint that I came in just minutes before closing. Chips good.  Salsa ok, lacked spice and seasoning.  Guacamole was ok, no salt, no lime, no cilantro, no spark.  Avocados were ripe and tasty. Carne asada burrito was good, not great.  Again the resonating thought is... bland. Flautas (my wife's order) looked and tased like the frozen version.  Disappointing.  Refried beans and rice were very plain. Tres leches cake was very good.  My wife's chocolate cake was grainy in the icing and dry in the cake.  Not the best combo. Not cheap either. Bill was close to 30 bucks.  Probably won't be back unless the get Ramsay kitchen nightmare make over.	3.0
I may be biased coming from San Francisco and Boston in terms of Mexican food. I decided to give the place a shot given the 5 star reviews and the relative new opening of the restaurant.  I didn't have high expectations by any means, but I thought it'd be a decent meal. First thing that shocked me was the prices.  It's cheaper than other types of food because it is still Mexican food, but it was on the high end for an order here and take to your seat place. The service was great by all means, the employees were hispanic and very friendly.  The kitchen looked fine.  Nothing was wrong with the decor. I found that the food lacked bang for the buck.  For $7 I got two carne asada tacos, a slice of avocado, rice and refried beans.  The tacos were on the portion of Taco bell $2 value meal size.  The quality much better than Taco Bells, but falls short of other Mexican places as the steak felt extra salty and extra cooked and not juicy enough.  My friends got the tamales which was grossly overpriced $9 and my other friend got the Nachos which did not look appealing at all although he said that they were good.  My friend who got the tamales said she must have bitten into chicken bouillon cubes that did not finish cooking with the rice.  I didn't really have any issues with my food aside from the whole damn, this is it? Couple of other things, there was only 1 fork left at the help yourself utensils area and there were like a basket full of spoons.  Chips and salsa looked like they were free, again a help yourself, but was not very clear. I won't come back.  I am not sure where the five starrers have been in terms of Mexican, but this place is nice and quaint and all, just not enough to make it a repeat. Again, nothing wrong with the service and the employees, food was mediocre at best and more expensive than I'd imagine for what I/my group got.  I would recommend that you come and see for yourself, it just wasn't for me.	2.0
This place is horrible! Second time i place an order on the phone only to get there and to tell me they do not have what i wanted. They could have told me over the phone, instead of me taking the ride there for nothing! The service is horrible , the food is a hit or miss....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OVERPRICED FOOD!	1.0
Got 3 sandwiches (~$7-8 each) to go and applied my livingsocial deal of $10 for $20 and paid $4.50 for taxes/difference. Roast Turkey $6.50 - Roast turkey, havarti, mesclun, honey mustard YUM! lots of creamy havarti cheese. I dded avocado slices to my wrap. It was so good~ just enough amount of honey mustard to balance out the saltiness of the turkey cold cut. Daily sandwich special: Meatball parmagian $6.95 - 4 large (~1.25 inches in circumference) meatballs with stringy cheese. This took a little longer than the cold sandwiches. The bread was toasted and the inside soaked up some of the tomato sauce so it was a bit mushy but it's a tolerable mushiness due to the crunchy outside. Brooklyn $6.95 - Grilled chicken, jack cheese, tomato, Romaine and pesto mayo on French bread. Again added my own avocado and heated it up via toaster. Reassembled the sandwich and it was amazing.. i was the envy of the office. :) without the groupon, slightly pricey but with the groupon, awesome deal!	3.0
This used to be a go to place for lunch.  They do charge extra for everything. The food is good but now overpriced as they have done away with their puch card and David Alan bucks which rewarded and encouraged repeat customers but allowing them to get up to 30% off by prepaying. For this price there are many other places in the area to discover.	2.0
the food is okay here, but the cost is extremely high. the salads are okay, but overpriced at $8.50 - the lettuce is either white or brown, and i'm not sure they're using top-quality meats. the last time i went there, they forgot to include the salad dressing that i asked for. overall, not worth the cost - there are better delis close by.	2.0
Bought the Chicken Caesar Salad today.  It was a big salad, but it was SUPER salty.  Not sure if it's the dressing that I got with it (Ceasar) or what, but wow, I can feel my blood pressure going up as I write this!  lol.	2.0
I used to love this place. Now, not so much. I used to go here for lunch because it is so close to my work. The salads are the best. The bad thing is that eventhough lunch starts at 11, they won't have the specialty salads out until about 11:45. I waited yesterday for like a good 20 minutes. It sucked. Also, the staff behind the counters are unfriendly and not helpful. However, the two girls that are cashiers are very nice and helpful. I think I'm gonna ban this place. It is expensive and they always charge you "extra" for everything.	2.0
Heard alot about this restaurant, went with friends the service was so-so, the food literal;ly sucked,  appetizers were over-rated; all the dinners came out cold and over cooked, the lobster was cold and tasteless, fish was cold all-in-all dinner was over-priced and not worth the trip to this place anyone who thinks it is great knows nothing about food.   NEVER WILL GO BACK OR RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT I LIKE.	1.0
Our server was terrible . My cousin ordered the large shrimp and if the server was any good he should have asked her if she meant prawns. Instead he came over 3 times and said she was wrong. Then to add to the insult he charged her for 2 dinners because while she waited her husband ate 1 shrimp. Tonight was disappointing service was terrible. In 15 years it has never been like this . My family has brought many people here and this isn the way customers should be treated. It was insulting! .	1.0
Last night my wife and I went to Fernandes for dinner and after waiting about fifteen minutes we were offered a table on the second floor which we turned down because of it's location, smack in the middle of the salad bar and kitchen traffic (waiters, trays, people walking by, etc.).  We were sent back downstairs to the Maître D and he gave us a seemingly non working contraption to hold as we sat at the bench by the front door for a while, hoping for a table.  We saw other couples and groups come in and walk past us, getting seated as we waited for close to an hour.  We also witnessed many leaving, where in my mind at some point we could have been seated where they had been.   The Maître D for our last fifteen minutes there, was not even at his post as we continued to wait. This Maître D is the same person that on other occasions has thanked us and asked for us to come back to dine.  I guess last night, the Maître D forgot about having previously invited their guest back to dine -or-they were too busy to sit just us two.  Too busy, to please two middle aged married persons who wish to have a moment together after a long week of hard work.   Maybe, to the Maître D we were the sacrifice of the evening or the two that would not be pleased, since the Maître D did not even welcome us to sit at the bar while they prepared a table -or- at least an "I'm sorry you wish to leave".  We know not to expect an immediately available table on a Friday night and at a popular spot.  We know to wait also, and to expect hospitality from a well priced restaurant where we've patronized before and where we have been encouraged to come back.  All in all, to come back for what? when a guest is brought to the point of feeling unwelcomed.	1.0
Terrible reservation and waiting system.  We ended up leaving after waiting for nearly an hour after being told the wait was going to be 45 minutes.  Asked the host how much longer the wait was going to be and was told that there were reservations for 9 pm (it was 8:55) and we would have to wait for them to be seated and those tables to finish their meals.  I had also noticed many people with reservations actually ended up waiting for about 15-20 minutes before being seated.  Based on there seating system, I would not return to this establishment.  I am sure the food is pretty good but I will not be the one to find out.	1.0
This place sucks we got there around 10 pm for the night club the band was playing  some merengue were really out of tune and screaming as oppose to singing we order drinks and went dancing when we came back my girlfriend cell was gone and so were the drinks this place is a shit hole you might wannastay home instead unless you dont mind getting robbed., again stay out of this place...	1.0
If you love meat I guess this is meat heaven.  I ordered the fish, shrimp and scallops. It was awful, the fish was soggy , scallops, soooo salty,  no taste at all. The only thing only thing on my plate that was okay, were  the two shrimp. Oh, and the potatoe chips........ When I ordered my meal, the waiter said, "good choice"..... So, if you like good fish do not order any from here, stick to the meat.   Would not go back.	1.0
Was there this past Sunday made reservations for 2 @ 5pm and it was almost 6pm and we still were't seated.  I was disgusted with the way hosts treated us and those people along with us that also had reservations.  The place looked to cramped and I ended up leaving and I went else where, were the food was excellent and the service was exceptional.	1.0
The restaurant is located in a not very pleasant neighborhood and getting there is a challenge; you better have a decent SUV since the roads are all in a pretty bad shape. Good thing is that the restaurant has its own parking. The staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is warm and somewhat noisy. The menu (judged by the list of dishes) is truly outstanding. Now, why I cannot give it more than "two starts". The restaurant marked at having slightly above average price. This (I assumed) should come with something "above average".  However... and this is where I have to warn those who want to visit this place: either reserve/ask for a table which is NOT the closest to the kitchen, or be brave enough to ask for a cut nex to the surface when you are ordering Rodizio. I've got a table which was the first on the way from the kitchen and I didn't have guts to ask for a slice of meat which is not the burned-and-spiced surface one. As a result, I didn't get a single decent piece to taste. Was it my fault? Possibly...	2.0
The service doesn't live up to the expectation created by the atmosphere and price. They have the authentic pineapples at the end of rodizio, but they only come around for a few rounds. We were looked at disrespectfully because of not wearing suits.	2.0
This restaurant is known for its rodizio; they are very good, and come around very often. However, it is overrated and overpriced. 1. A plate of pasta with chicken $19.25. Hell no!!! Never again, it wasn't even Vodka Sauce same goes for the Alfredo Sauce.   2. A pitcher of sangria $23, Hell no!! You are better off going to Adegas Grill $17 / Sagres $20 or even Fornos $21.   If you wan to impress a date, please take them to Fornos; a bit expensive but cuisine and service are spectacular.	2.0
Being a Newark native, this is not the overall best Portuguese restaurant in Newark, but the rodizio is good. The biggest complaint about the restaurant are the servers. They're not as friendly as you'd like them to be. If you can overlook snotty looks for some decent steak then this place is good for you.	3.0
Great food! Rude Bartender	3.0
Went there on July 23, 2011, for the first time, went with my wife, my best friend and his wife. place is very nice, the food is up there with Solar do Minho, for which we all been going to for many years. I would go there in the future, but what turned us off was just after paying the bill, the waiter came to us and asked us to hurry up cause they needed the table for others, it was 10pm I didn't notice anyone waiting for a table, the bar wasn't busy at all, and I also saw other open tables. This was very unprofessional. I give it only 3 starts cause of them telling us to leave	3.0
Party of 4 got seated no problem on a Sunday afternoon. We all did the rodizio. Service is friendly, but maybe a bit on the slow side. Bread for the table is delicious. Red sangria was yummy. Was told to get the creme brulee but wound up unimpressed. Their flan was much better in my opinion. The reason for the one star is the fact that all four of us got VIOLENTLY ILL all through the night and next morning. I honestly would have just let it slide and opted not to write a review if we had all just gotten tummy aches or something, or if it hadn't been every single member of our party, but I'm talking repeatedly vomiting plus diarrhea and of course losing sleep. Now about half of the meat we got was pretty good and tasty, but the other half was subpar. The subpar meat had a metallic taste - I just thought they had overcooked; it didn't actually taste or smell like rotten meat. But I guess it's more a reflection of the cleanliness of their establishment. Such a shame. It's a good 30 hours later and I'm still in pain. Never coming back, ever!	1.0
My family and I went to Fernandes for the Chrisfmas Buffet.  I was very disappointed.  The buffet was 1-5..,,and I arrived at 2:30.  They did not replenish any of the food.  And what was left was dried out and cold.  And at 46.95 (plus tax and tip) I was hoping to get my money's worth.  Needless to say I didn't have much to eat.  The only good thing was when Santa came.	1.0
So I would have given this place 5 stars because every time I come here I enjoy it very much. It is actually my favorite place to go and tonight I decided to go there for my birthday dinner. I'm so disappointed I probably will not be going back. My favorite dish is the fernandes and getting the stone to cook it yourself (I get it every time) I come here at least once a month. Tonight the waiter brought me the wrong dish and refused to fix it so I spoke to manager who was also rude and told me "he'll do me the favor" and to top it of the waiter came asking us why did we tell his manager on him . I'm in shock still and did not even get desert for my birthday!!!!! Totally ruined my night !!!!! I will be calling tomorrow to talk to the owner I am so upset	1.0
I was not impressed at all. They took forever to serve my food and when I finally got my meal it was cold. I told the waiter it was cold and he brought it back warmer but it was black. It looked like charcoal. The rice was also disgusting. And on top of everything my meal was very pricey. I've been sitting in here for 3 hours. I give this place a thumbs down. I will never come here again and I don't recommend anyone to come here.	2.0
This place is very impressive with the decor of a castle mixed with  a cozy cabin.  My friends suggested dining here after a show at the prudential center.  It was a mad house with 1 hour wait for dinner.  Within the waiting room was a refrigerated case window showing thick cuts of meat and fish.  That too was exciting.  Since i went to a show on a girls out night, we were a group of young women.  Versed enough on where women get seated, next to the wait station with a slippery floor i ask for one of the other visible tables available.  Well, that was a no go so we sat, still looking forward to a memorable meal.  True, they do provide an abundance of food.  However, it became obvious that this is a tourist destination and the quantity was not worth the quality. Skip it and go to casa verde if you want some creative and authentic Portuguese food.  My dog is enjoying my leftovers.	2.0
Decided to try this restaurants due to all the reviews for my birthday dinner. The service was great, and the free valet parking was awesome. I personally tried the Rodizio and was not a fan because I am a all red meat kind of girl. Not a fan of pork. The rest of the food was alright. Another thing that I did not like was that the red velvet cake tasted old. Will not be trying this place again. Way better restaurants in the area.	3.0
If you go for the rodizio ($28) you'll be disappointed if you expect $50 quality. The service was attentive but the meat was over cooked and salted and not too special . They try to mask this with coating it in cheese, bacon or garlic and 2 of the items are awful sausages and chicken. but that's not why people come to a Brazilian steak house. Usually there is at least one cut that is impressive but here there is not, even the ribs were dry. I think this place is not to the standards that it once was.	3.0
The place is nice and cozy. I like the atmosphere a lot. The service was decent. But the food was extremely bland.  We even specified to the guy taking our order that we wanted the food to be spicy. He said ok, even wrote it down. When the food came out, the guy who bought it out said they can't make paella spicy--um, I'm pretty sure you can make anything spicy. But anyway, it wasn't spicy. I ordered breaded shrimp with pasta, also definitely not spicy . Not much taste at all unfortunately. A little bit of seasoning would've gone a long way...oh well. Probably won't be back.	3.0
After reading So many good reviews on this place, I knew I had to give it a try. Especially for the rodiZio and the sangria. Sadly though, I think there's too much hype about this place. The meats offered were good. Their sides and salad bar are a poor excuse of side dishes.	3.0
Location is not very good, but parking with valet is good option. I had the Caribbean ribeye which is large at 24oz but it was tough and not that tasty. Service was pretty slow. Salad bar was barely adequate. The valet guy was pretty good though...	2.0
Love Newark's Ironbound. Love the great restaurants....didn't love this place. The first time I went, the service and food were outstanding. Word of advice: DO NOT GET ANYTHING BUT THE RODIZIO...*steps down from soap box* The second time we went it was such a let down. Group of 8, screwed up 1 dish which took another 20 minutes to come out, actually accused my friend of ordering the wrong thing hence why the wrong item came out...seriously dude, 7 other people witnessed her ordering her dish...don't f-ing lie! Anyway, the rodizio is the best in Newark. Quality cuts of meat, oversalted and cooked perfectly. If you go with the seafood, you will get cheap, crappy seafood. Yup, it's what you pay for. Everyone who didn't order seafood was disappointed with their meal. Their Sangria is top notch. The overload it with ice and fruit, which is annoying, and they charge a bounty for it. Every meal comes with the salad bar. It's not a schmorgesborg of stuff but it's enough to hold you over for the meat orgy. Another word of advice: Don't fill up on the salad bar and bread, as tempting as it is. 3rd word of advice: Ask for the ice on the side for the sangria. 4th word of advice: If you like a particular meat (turkey wrapped in bacon and their sausage come to mind), don't be shy to have multiple pieces. You are the boss at these meat buffet's...get your moneys worth. Other than the incident with service and the clowns who didn't order rodizio, it was a memorable evening... 5th word of advice: Make room for dessert. Seriously we ordered all of them and split them. Every one of them was heavenly! ENJOY (if you get the rodizio)... :-)	3.0
Went for an early dinner on a Wednesday around 5 pm. Three of us ordered the all you can eat rodizio. They only had a few tables occupied at the time. They were quick to seat us and take our order. However once we ordered, it took awhile before we got served. For the first 10 minutes the food was nonstop to the point where my plate was almost over flowing. I couldn't keep up with their pace. However after the first 10 minutes, the servers never came back. I was not hungry, but could definitely eat more. After sitting there for another 30 minutes without being served, one of the waiters reluctantly came over to ask if we wanted more. At which point we only got 1 more serving. They definitely do not serve you until you say stop. They stop whenever they want. In addition, their food is super salty. Couldn't really tell what meat I was eating. Everything just taste like salt. Overall, I was not impressed.	2.0
First off, there's nothing special in the Ironbound. Food in quantity, not quality. It's amazing how many ppl rate these establishments as excellent. This said, I've always had fun going to these places, as long as your dining expectations are gauged accordingly. Therefore, my rating reflects those reduced expectations. :) Being a steakhouse, one would expect a thorough steak menu such as those at Gallagher's, Luger's, or even Del Frisco's. However, you're not getting true steakhouse fare here; it's the Ironbound after all. So, you're getting a less than Prime cut of beef, sometimes cooked to your liking. The one thing that always stood out to me is the service, however. They did a good job making our group comfortable, and getting the order right, which really is important to keep the fun flowing. In the end, we all had a great time, because everything was fine overall.	3.0
This review does not cover the Rodizio aspect of the restaurant as we ordered off the menu. The atmosphere is very nice and has a Spanish/Mediterranean in feel.  The service was decent contrary to other reviews I have read elsewhere.  We did get there at 4:30pm for dinner (pre-theater) and the place was already buzzing with people.  By around 5:30 it looked fairly packed. I was looking forward to two dishes, the mixed broiled seafood platter and the garlic shrimp.  Both were a huge disappointment.   I have had Iberian style garlic shrimp many times both in the US and in Spain and wanted very much to experience something similar.  Instead of receiving a dish of shrimp in sauce in a clay dish, we got shrimp with the sauce in a separate small bowel with rice and steamed vegetables.  Although the shrimp were not overcooked, this was nothing like garlic shrimp and did not come close to the correct flavors of the dish.  When I mentioned this to the server in a very nice manner, I pretty much received a response of we don't really do it this way.  Very surprising for this type of place. Now the worse part of the meal was the broiled seafood platter.  It was meant for two people and the quantity was good for the purpose.  However, all the seafood was barely warm and very dried out.  It was probably sitting somewhere for a long time.  The flavors were off and it was a huge let down since the people I was with were really looking forward to this meal. Since the restaurant had such low standards we and we simply dealt with it.   We also had the strip steak presented in a clay tile.  The steak was very stringy and nowhere near as good of a steak as I have had in many other places.  Again, low quality! The bread was very good, although we did not have a chance to dip it into the garlic shrimp dish as I was looking forward to doing. Overall, I would not go back to this place.  Its very overrated and the quality of food and preparation is not worth it.  Find an authentic spot in town and enjoy the food, even if the atmosphere is not as nice.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.	1.0
Cooked myself a filet mignon and lobster tail on hot stone, which didn't actually stay hot for that long. I ended up having to cut the steak and cook it in sections as it was on the very rare side of medium rare. Food tasted fine, service was a bit spotty.	3.0
It's possible that I am being really hard on this place, but I would only give 2.5 stars if I was able to. My review is not based solely off the rodizio like many below. Came here for my sisters birthday and let me first start by saying that the restaurant itself is beautiful. I liked the architecture and the ambiance very much. Rustic enough but with a touch of elegance. Very nice. The red sangria was excellent. Strong and very satisfying. Unfortunately, after receiving our shrimp in garlic sauce, my rating started to go down. Almost every shrimp I tasted had that unpleasant iodine flavor, indicating to me that they were overcooked. Not a good way to start off the meal. The garlic sauce was mediocre to some other places I've had it. We had a mixed bag of entrees including, pallea valencia, veal with almond sauce, churrasco à Fernandes, and the picadinho misto. Sadly, the pallea was bland and everything it contained was very overcooked. The lobster was incredibly chewy and and the sausage was dry as a bone. This is not what we were hoping for. It was very disappointing and overly fishy tasting. The leftovers were unfortunately not even brought home. The picadinho was delicious, however the inconsistency in the way the meat was cooked was frustrating. One bite you would have a soft delicious piece of pork or beef, the next was a tough piece of grizzle or overcooked meat. The Spanish sauce was okay, nothing memorable. The same goes for the veal with almond sauce. It lacked flavor and was truly nothing memorable. My father had the churrsaco and I can understand why people come here for the meat. I sampled a variety of the meats and it was flavorful, not over salted, and had a pleasant amount of smokey flavor. If I return, I would need to try the rodizio as this truly seems to be their star.	2.0
I came her with my boyfriend who ordered the rodizio while I got the Veal with shrimp in garlic sauce. They say you can't share the rodizio which is true but they let me eat off of his plate to try his food. The waiters are very nice and friendly. The chicken from the rodizio was delicious and moist, the steaks were good but after a couple they all started to taste the same. The cheeseteak one was not good and very salty. They bring out cubed cheese which was salty and gross. I've been to Iberia were they also give out grilled pineapples at the end for dessert, Iberia's was so much better. The grilled pineapples here weren't caramelized like they should have been it is dusted with some cinnamon but tastes like the charcaol they used to grill everything   I think Iberia is a little better and has better sides too. The Veal I has was good but not great, the shrimp wasn't overcooked so that was also good, I have to say the garlic sauce is delicious and probably one of the best. The bread they give you is also good and the salad bar loked fresh because they kept changing it and restocking the salad bar items. The rice that came with the Veal was salty and the fried potatoe chips were not the best I've had, they were a little soggy. I had the Veal and shrimp in garlic saice for leftovers two days later though and it was honestly better as leftovers than when I had it that day.	3.0
I usually eat at Fornos. I wanted to try something new I read so many good reviews about Fernandez so I wanted to give it a try. For starters I ordered calamari as an appetizer that wasn't good it was very rubbery, and for my meal I ordered the tile ribeye and shrimp that was delicious. I have mixed review on this restaurant. If your looking for good steaks this is the place for you. The rodizio is ok the meats are little salty. Service was just ok could have been a lot better for the 500.00 bucks we spent on our meal. For me Fornos is a lot classier has better service and you get a lot more food portions for your money and their garlic shrimp and rice is to die for. So if your looking for an elegant restaurant this is not the place for you. But if your looking for steaks this is the place. So with that being said will go again only for the tile steak.	3.0
My son-in-law comes here with coworkers from PSEG on a regular basis and raves about the food.  This was their "go-to" place to eat when working round-the-clock during the Sandy aftermath.  We arrived with three kids and three adults on a Wednesday evening for dinner.  The service was friendly  and attentive - no complaints. I ordered the shrimp with garlic which was served cold with sauce so salty it overshadowed any hint of garlic.  The fried potatoes on my plate appeared as crushed - as in bits and ends, soggy and cold, not the usual full potato chip style.  Very disappointing.  My grandson had penne vodka with shrimp which was drowned in sauce, but was flavorful.    Granddaughter had chicken alfredo which was actually quite good as was a flank steak dish my son-in-law had.  My daughter had a chicken, shrimp and mushroom dish which also was swimming in sauce.  Less is more in regard to sauce. A better choice would be with rodizo as we watched it being served to other tables and it looked delicious.  Consistency seems to be an issue which the server should monitor.  My dish shouldn't have even left the kitchen due to the difference in the potatoes I received versus what the rest of the table had.  Appreciate the hospitality offered to the PSEG crew, but I have two favorite restaurants on Ferry Street that never disappoint.	2.0
I got the rodizio or what I call it, the churrascaria. Prices are reasonable, albiet the guy serving us/taking care of us was really awkward and weird. Like, I would move my cup or my fork to where I like it to be, and he moved them back... like..dude...don't touch my silverware. Other than that, the food is good, as in the seafood paella my sister got and the filet mignon my nieces got to share on the hot stone tablet was excellent, but my 3 stars comes from the actual meat they had. I've been to several churrascarias- Fogo de Chao/M Grill (LA) and Espetus (SF) and Brazzaz (Chicago), Pikanha Brazilian BBQ (East Bay, CA)  as well as a few places in Brasil itself so .....this place was okay. Granted they say it's a "Spanish restaurant" but the rodizio is the same thing. Meats are all okay, some were just way too salty. My favorite from any place is the picanha which is top sirloin cap. THAT is my favorite piece. For the most part, the meats that went around were cooked more than medium rare, which is what I like.  You just have to indicate to them what you'd like. Their chicken hearts are bleh. MY FAVORITE after the picanha is always the chicken hearts, if they have them. Over here, the meat was dry and it had a weird taste. They weren't juicy and perfectly cooked here. boo. Considering the reviews, I guess this place is better than any other places, but in CA where I'm from, it wouldn't fly with me. They give you all the side dishes too including rice, beans, plantains, etc. But their salad bar there is kind of sad. I was hoping they had the pao de quiso (In argentina they called them Chipas) but they didn't have that delicious cheese bread they usually have. If you were at this restaurant, do not pass up their paella. it was delicious.	3.0
Not a fan at all!!  Had a surf and turf, steak was over cooked and awful, lobster tail was disgusting, crab cake had to have been frozen because it was all water and mush, stuffed shrimp was ok. Went home and was sick for two hours during the night. Will never go back to this place again!!	1.0
Perhaps an off night. Most reviews are good to great but I found it unremarkable. The food was decent. The Sangria was like HiC with alcohol which if that is what you like must be nice... Not my version of good. I wouldn't return.	3.0
I would have given Fernandes a better rating but the service SUCKED!!! The waiter kept ignoring us our food was given to us about an hour later lol... I guess that's what happens when you go on a busy Friday. They really need more waiters on the weekends. Just saying...  Now to the good part the food was 4.5 stars I would say I had the garlic shrimp yum loved it!!! The calamari's I can live without they were a bit hard and COLD... The sangria was ok I've had better (wayyyyyy better lol). Over all for a busy Friday night in Ironbound it was overall OK.. Oh yeah dessert was grrrreat that I give 5 stars bahahaha	3.0
Came here with high expectations because it was recommended to me by several people.  I'd give it another go but I just wasn't overly impressed.  Don't get me wrong, it was solid... but not as good as Don Pepe or Forno's... They also sorta screwed us out of the lunch special, conveniently forgetting to tell us about the free drink included and then charging us for a pitcher of sangria...  tisk tisk!	3.0
Great place to come with friends and family.  The selection is outstanding.  Some of the meats were saltier then others so if that is something that bothers you just ask the servers.   Good service and relaxing atmosphere.   Love to go back and try new dishes.	3.0
I was around New Jersey, and we've decided to eat here because there are a lot of stars and reviews. The service was great. People were nice. However, the food. The food didn't do the stars any justice. Sure, they give a large portion of food, but it's nasty, tasteless, and dry. My sister asked for a spicy dish, but it was sweet. The meat was dry. I would not come here again. It wasn't that good.	2.0
I ate at Fernandes Steakhouse for the second time last time with friends who were visiting from Mexico.  It is also the second time I've ordered the rodizio there.   Let me start with the good.  The service is excellent.  The meat is typically cooked to perfection.  Weordered the mang mousse pie dessert and it was excellent.  We also ordered a pitcher of "blue sangria" and even though it was a big deviation from typical sangria ingredinets it still had the underlying sangria flavor.  Even though the restaurant is in a not-too-nice area, there is valet parking, so that is a plus. Now the reasons I only gave it two stars.  First, the consistency of their meats between my two visits were completely opposite.  The first time I came the short ribs and the flank steak were the two best meats that came out.  The short ribs were tender and succulent and fell off the bone.  The flank steak melted like butter in your mouth and was bursting with flavor.  They were so good that I was recommending them to my Mexican friends.  Meanwhile, the first time the sirloin and filet cuts were a little on the dry and tough side.  However, this time is was the complete opposite.  The flank steak was tough and lacking in flavor, while the short ribs were tough and hard to remove from the bone.  Meanwhile, the bacon-wrapped filet and sirloin were the two best cuts.  It good that you get to try all the different cuts, since it's rodizio, because if I had just ordered a flank steak entree based on my previous experience, I would have been hugely disappointed. The second reason I gave it a three is just because of the sheer amount of slat used in the meats.  Maybe it's what helps contribute to the general flavor quality of all their meats, but I think it goes well into the area of excessive.  It's the second time I've walked out of there feeling puffy, like I could kill any snail just my getting within 30 feet of it. All in all it'sa good restaurant, and my wife wants to go there for her birthday next month, so maybe my opinion will change for the better when I try one of their entrees instead of the rodizio.	3.0
I took my grandmother here before her flight back to northwest Arkansas thinking she would enjoy an authentic Brazilian/Portuguese dining experience.  First, the restaurant itself is beautiful inside, but it's a shame they ruined the atmosphere with televisions and loud music (at noon on a Sunday, no less).  Second, the wait service was FANTASTIC.  They are thoroughly attentive, but never intrusive - a very difficult balance to achieve.  Unfortunately, the food was a big disappointment, especially given the price.  I had the 2lb lobster special, broiled.  It came out waaaay overcooked and rubbery, and was a big waste of about $35.  My grandmother ordered the european sea bass (the waiter informed us the Chilean sea bass was frozen, but the european was fresh) with brocolli rabe and potatoes.  After sampling my grandmother's plate, we both agreed that the bass was cooked to perfection, but it and the sides were bland and boring.  Fernandes -- you have quality ingredients, but your chefs need to learn how to cook.  As for the drinks, I had a red and then a white sangria.  The alcohol in both drinks was overpowering.  When I drink sangria, I want a soft, fruity and refreshing experience, but this was like drinking rubbing alcohol.  Yuck. I give Fernandes two stars instead of one because the waitstaff was exceptional.  However, I will not be back, especially when I KNOW I can get an amazing meal and sangria at a place like Casa Vasca for the same or better price.	2.0
Good place- a little pricy - steak is good but again, not steakhouse quality like a Sparks in NYC or Black Horse in Mendham. I recommend going here for the western euro experience, but again the best steaks are not served at any Portuguese restaurant - seafood is.	3.0
The food is amazing but here is the reason they are getting one star.  It starts from when making reservations.  The owner Terry is a jerk not nice over the phone I'm not expecting to be schmoozed but I was asking a simple question about the group I was making reservations for and the response I got was, "Now your asking for too much!"  I was shocked I know everyone has bad days but this isn't the first time I experienced rudeness from this place.   Another instance was after my group was finishing up dinner a manager dressed in a suit asked if were finished so we can leave to seat other people.  My group and I were disgusted with the place and left.  I tried to give this place another chance but it didn't even make it.  Beware the owner is a complete jerk.  Yes the food is top notch but I'd rather deal with average to good with great customer service.	1.0
Place was packed so we waited about 45 minutes for a table which I expected on Saturday night. Sat upstairs which is a very large room. They sat us next to a bachelor party of like 18 guys. These guys were loaded up on booze and started being abusive to all the women in the room. Were actually rating girls as they were seated and throwing around curses every other word. It wasn't like they were whispering this stuff they were shouting it so they all could hear each other in this loud room. Couple next to us left as the girl was not able to take it. I was with my 2 sons and wife and they were amazed this was happening. Management didn't want to lose this big check so didn't throw them out. Instead they just were apologizing to others for their bad behavior. This restaurant has some of the best food in the Ironbound but I expect a place to maintain some kind of decorum. This is the stuff that happens in the post dinner portion of the bachelor party at some strip club. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.	1.0
The paella was okay.  A bit dry.  Definitely a place to go for the Rodizio.  The salad bar was small compared to other places in Newark.  The meats were good quality.  Off the beaten path from Ferry Street.	3.0
A carnivores wet dream!!!!!! I went to fernandez steakhouse with an empty stomach and walked out one of the happiest men,  since Ralphy got his red rider B B gun in the Christmas Story.  The servers start and its a tidal wave of meat hitting u all at once.  This endless buffet of various cuts of meats, had me waving my white flag when it was over.  Lol.  The fresh cuts of juicy and tender meats put me in a crazed carnivorous consumption.  This is a top steak house for me. And all that meat for 28 bucks u cant go wrong.   And don't forget the refreshing sangria. ***I edited this restaurant due to the fact i went to a better steakhouse and this one dosent even compare to Peter Luger's Steakhouse.	3.0
Ok so I dont know how Im even able to draft this review, since Im in a severe food coma presently.  Ill make this short and to the point.  Think of ALL the meats you enjoy and this place with have them all and about 10+ more.  We had the rodizio and the meats were all good but not Great.  I thought only the ham and filet wrapped in bacon were exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much standard as far are taste.  They did have PLENTY of different meats though (even steak stuff with cheese).  Prime rib, filet, ribeye, chicken, sausage, turkey, pork loin, garlix steak.. yada yada.  Delish grilled pineapple dessert.  One complaint... The salad bar was waaayyy to small.  Salad, potatoe salad, and olives, thats pretty much it.  It was $28.75 pp... Bill was $72 for two people with no alchol!  Id probably go back if the salad bar was bigger.  But there are many other places to try that are similar in the area.  So this wasnt exactly short but atleast you might find it helpful.	3.0
We went with a group for a birthday party last Friday, and boy was I looking forward to a meat festival.  Going in, I had no doubt that I was going to order the Rodizio.  Skewered meat after skewered meat would be brought to my table, sliced into piles just waiting on my American gluttony to take over. After we arrived, and took our seat, we ordered two pitchers of the red sangria, which did not disappoint.  The apples soaking up the alcohol were crisp (and sodden with wine!) and tasty.  I've had sangria many times when you can tell the apples are leftovers: squishy, mealy, and bad.  not these. The salad bar and bread that came with the meal were fantastic.  A great salad bar, with plenty of options to put on your plate, and warm bread. Unfortunately, the Rodizio left a lot to be desired.  The meat came out fast and furious, but several of the cuts lacked flavor.  By the time the chicken hearts came to the table, I was luckily done for.  Some of the options were really impressive, the bacon-wrapped ones being my favorites. My review, I might add, is somewhat tainted by my post-meal experience.  Perhaps my gut just isn't used to having a variety of nothing but meat to digest, but it did not digest it well.  Several others that went complained of the same digestive challenges.  The worst experience, however, was the one friend who tossed and turned all night having vivid nightmares which he referred to as "meatmares."  I can't say for sure that his meatmares are due to the parade of meats, but he did say that's very uncommon. If you go, I still say get the Rodizio.  If you go *back*, I would avoid the Rodizio and stick with a lower priced option.	3.0
Meh. The service sucks and the food is nothing special.	2.0
I'm going to sum it up. Good food at a not so good place. Fernandes is a restaurant in Newark which serves peninsula food. (iberian food). Its located in a pretty bad part of town by ironbound standards, but fortunately has a private parking lot with valet parking. Bar area downstairs seems pretty nice with a nice atmosphere. Upstairs dining room has plenty of tables and it has a disorganized feel to it. Tables are scattered in no particular order. Servers are fast and efficient. Prices are average. Food is actually very good, but I would not expect much on the seafood side here. Of the times I've been there meat seems to be the thing to go with. Its incredibly loud and busy, but some people actually prefer that. During the night , they have the annoying guys who don't work for the restaurant trying sell you flowers or take a picture for a price. I personally think any restaurant that allows that, is cheesy. On occasion they have Mariachis going around doing the same, which I don't get. Iberian food or culture has nothing to do with Mariachi. They should move down to the Mexican restaurant. With so many others places in the area, I personally would choose others restaurants, but some of my friends swear by the food.	3.0
Came here with my family for my birthday and was extremely disappointed. I made a 9 PM reservation because we had prior commitments and upon arriving we were told we could wait by the bar until we were seated. The bar was packed so we waited in the hotel lobby that separates the bar and the restaurant. For a 2-starred restaurant, they were awfully unaccommodating as they didn't even offer us water as we waited more than 30 minutes to get seated. We were initially going to opt for the 6-course menu but because we were seated so late, we had to do 4-courses. As we sat down, one of the waiters, unprompted, asked us if we wanted a vegetarian menu. I don't know what else it could have been other than racial profiling. The meal began with 8 amuse bouches, all of questionable quality. Because an amuse bouche is so small, it's supposed to be as close to perfect as possible. Every single one of them save for MAYBE one was underwhelmed/flat out bad. Overall, the food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either and when a restaurant has the distinction that Juni does and charges as much as they do, underwhelming just won't cut it. The ingredients were clearly fresh and high-quality but the dishes just didn't work. Everything was under seasoned. The service was difficult to place as the waiters were attentive for the most part but in the worst ways. I went to the restroom with an empty water glass and returned 5 minutes later with a still-empty glass on the table. Unacceptable for a water glass to be empty at all but to remain empty for that long when the restaurant is essentially empty because it is so late is flat out ridiculous. The servers took our plates before we finished our food multiple times and we were honestly so displeased with our experience that we didn't even bother to ask for the mediocre garbage we were served back. A sad excuse for a fine-dining establishment.	1.0
WORST RED LOBSTER EVER. We waited for a table forever even though there was a vacant table right near the waiting area -___-. They took forever to clean it and get us seated. Our server was amazing though, her name was Rubina. Other than that this place sucks.	1.0
Went there cuz my daughter was craving Lobster. 25 min wait - okay for 4th of July/Friday - not an issue. Waitress was not very ...let's say attentive. My wife had to repeat her drink order 3 times (water with lime). Drink prices are not listed on any menu - no idea what the Mai Tai (which the condescending waitress insisted on telling me 4 times, that it contained alcohol) costs. Drink was full of ice with about an 1/2ounce of liquid total. Ordered a 20oz. Yueng Ling...seems like the waitress did not even make an effort to wait for the keg head to settle - the glass was a full head empty by the time I got it. I ordered the Fish n Chips - the worst EVER! The Fish patty(?) seemed refried from the previous day - dry and tasteless. I usually don't care if one thing is off, a server could be having a bad day or one food item is a little off, but this was one thing after another. My daughter liked her "Lobster on Lobster" and the warm biscuits. That was the only saving grace. I will not go here again.	1.0
Was the worst service , i ever had these kids of today could care less, just complain behind me how slow it is here and dont make enough. well first off do a better job and you will get bettere tips.	1.0
I visited this Red Lobster on Saturday.  First the 'unlimited' cheese biscuits were definitely limited.  After the first basket, the waitress never came back to offer more which is not what Red Lobster advertises on T.V.  I ordered flounder and I found it to be very small with no taste.  The grilled vegs and broccoli were also tasteless.  The ultimate feast was satisfactory according to my son.  My husband's chicken was also very small.  Within 20 minutes of leaving Red Lobster my lips were tingling and I had to use a restroom.  I immediately went home and was sick the rest of the night.  I am allergic to shellfish so I ordered the flounder.  Either my reaction was from cross-contamination of flounder with shrimp or the food was not tainted. I have eaten flounder in other restaurants with no reaction whatsoever.  I do not recommend this restaurant to people who are allergic to shellfish because their procedures need to be revised.  I also am not sure whether my reaction was from the bad fiounder.	1.0
1. Food was not so good only kid's foods were okay 2. Restaurant was smelly, I asked for some freshener no body cared 3. Service terrible, I went on Tuesday evening, not much crowded but still took a lot of time before somebody said "Hi" 4. Whole night felt all the discomfort Will NEVER EVER go back here again...	1.0
My husband had a gift card so he decided to order some food to go a couple of days ago.  We havent eaten there since we were kids so we were curious. Of course, when my husband brought our food home, my lobster bisque was not in the bag, but it was on our receipt and we paid for it.  We live too far to have gone back.  I called the restaurant twice and was put on hold twice, and both times My calls were completely ignored and no one bothered to come back to talk to me.  Sucky service. The food that we did get was rubbery, greasy, and just plain foul.  They did a very careless job packing the food to go, no tartar sauce with the fried platter, 7 soggy French fries as a side, and rubbery overlooked shrimp and lobster tail.  But there was a ton of ketchup. How can anyone eat those creepy cheddar lumpy Bisquick biscuits? So nasty. Their prices are insulting for what you get...$18 for.Frozen fried clam strips from the super market, bay scallops that are like greasy little erasers amidst a bunch of fried crumbs of something, and a piddly serving of overcooked flounder. Come to think of it, I deserved to get beat out of $6.75 for making the sad mistake of going there in the first place.  Lame, outdated menu that is way overpriced.   GROSS!!!!  Screw you, Red Lobster of Iselin, NJ....	1.0
This was the WORST food I have ever had. The service was horrible. Will NEVER EVER go back here again and will tell others to stay clear of this place.	1.0
I was there yesterday to pick an order up. I waited for the hostess for maybe 10 minutes to appear and to tell me to go to the bar. I waited at the bar for 30 minutes until I got the order. The restaurant was not full. I was not happy with the service and the food that I really enjoyed when I was there the last time was salty and not as good as the time before.	1.0
Twice bitten twice shy that some's up my two awful experiences with this Red Lobster. We had a hostess say she called me for our table 15 minutes ago while standing right in front of her she did not call me asked for the manager got our table. Another time my guest ordered fried shrimp it was so oily and over cooked that she could not eat it. We have decided to avoid this Red Lobster...	2.0
The great thing about this place is the bread. Other then that, this place is just another chain. The waiters are nice but it took forever to get our meal	2.0

I will be adding a photo of my receipt to go along with this review [CHECK #47577]. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!! I come here every now and again from the city opposed to the one on 42nd street. This is usually not too bad of a spot but it has gotten worst over the years. My parents used to bring us here every two weeks. They stopped. MY WAITER JAMES M or JIMMY as it said in his name tag was HORRIBLE! THE WORST! I was so disappointed, my friend and I almost walked out without even eating. We come into the restaurant at 8:55pm and we were told for 2 people it would be 35-30 minutes later. We decided since we had a movie to catch at 10pm and it was about 10 minutes away from this restaurant we would eat at the bar. All we wanted was claim chowder. THATS ALL. Two bowls of soup and of course the biscuits. THIS IS WHY I AM PISSED: [yes I'm crazy and noticed all times] We placed the order at the bar at 9:02pm with JAMES/JIMMY. He gave us the check at 9:05pm! Keep that in mind. He said he would place our order immediately and be right back. 9:12 rolls around and I yell over to him to please bring me and my friend a water...he said right away. At 9:17 I hear him call out to someone "Hey can you get me two clam chowders and a biscuit." ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? You gave me a check without even placing my order. He finally brings the water at 9:22. One at a time. He was too busy making drinks I guess. There were 2-3 people in the bar area. Finally at 9:26pm our food gets here. 20 MINUTES LATER FOR 2 DAMN SOUPS!!!!????? Mind you, by this time the people who were right before us and came to the bar to drink were seated and their appetizer orders were being taken [they were right behind us]/ ARE YOU KIDDING!!!!!! We had to leave by 9:35, 9:40 the latest and now i felt like i needed to inhale my really hot soup. He finally comes over to us at 9:35 and states "Im sort i had a rush...NOOOO the same people have been there. you made us wait 30 minutes and they cannot wait 30 seconds!? I guess we did not matter. So JAMES/JIMMY was chucking about it trying to save face. NO. YOU GAVE ME A BAD EXPERIENCE.   So my crazy order, my thousands of dollars order was too much for JAMES/JIMMY. Two bowls of soup...$12.82 total was too much to ask for. WILL I EVER RETURN? JAMES M/JIMMY made me NEVER want to return.	1.0
I was very disappointed in the food quality we order shrimp nachos that look like can cheese wiz on some stale chips with some mediocre shrimp in between. We had the endless shrimp that was nothing to write home about its a good thing that our gift card is good at several restaurant. ...	2.0
It seems that everytime I go to Red Lobster they offer less and less options. I realize that this is a seafood place first and foremost, but I miss the options that they used to offer. They useed to have a meal called Dockside Shrimp and Chicken. This would be two grilled seasoned chicken breasts, with a baked potato and a side of shrimp scampi. Along with the side salad and red lobster biscuits this was a very satisfying meal. They used to offer this for $10, but then it rose to $12, and then they removed it from the menu. I tried ordering this despite it not being on the menu, and depending on the place they charge you a different price. One place I got it for $15, another charged me $18. Now these days, their chicken breasts have gone down hill. They come to the table very dry and practically inedible. They do have one chicken dish that I'll sometimes order, Cajun Chick Alfredo. They used to cook this very good, but lately they seemed to forget how to make this. Their shrimp dishes are good, but not very filling. Their snow crab legs are also amazing, yet they are expensive and also not filling. While I do like most of the appetizers, but these appetizers are all made to share amongst the table. The appetizers I would love to get are tha nachos but no one eats them. This plate is huge and there's no way I can polish this off, I asked for a half order or a single order, but they don't accomodate. I believe they need to update their menu selection, and at the same time fix the service problem. Especially at the Woodbridge location, you can wait a good half hour before your order is taken and then another half hour for your check. Who has an extra hour to waste sitting in a restaurant, not me. While this used to be one of my favorites, it is a chain that I happily avoid now. Their prices a re too high, their menu is too unvaried, and the service at this location is the pits. I can see why Red Loberster went on the chopping block from Darden's chains.	2.0
Stay away!!!!! Horrible service and quality of food!!! Take the time to drive to another Red Lobster! I order a drink while I waited at the bar because I had a 45 min wait for the table. The bartender took about 15 mins to acknowledge me then proceeded to charge me first before even making my drink. I waited 30 mins before my drink was made because he forgot. My drink arrived to my table without a straw! There were no silver ware at the table. Our salsa came out and we waited 5 minutes while the waitress looked for silverware. It's just a nightmare I can't even go on. I won't ever return to this red lobster! I should of went to Olive Garden smh!!!	1.0
Not a very good dining experience. I ordered from the create your own and was expecting something more sumptuous than what I actually received. The shrimp used in the scampi were extremely small and flimsy. The seafood stuffed flounder was non-existent. The bread was good but I remember this chain being so much better. Bitterly disappointing.	1.0
Why do people give us gift cards for here??? Seriously, I wanted to vomit.  We ordered lobster, scallops, shrimp and crabs.  The lobster tasted like buttered rubber.  The scallops had something weird on the end of it.  The shrimp was like eating chewy buttery paper.  The corn was literally dripping with butter. Why did I give this place 2 stars you ask?  I will have to say, the wine was delicious & the service was actually really good.  Someone needs to take that waitress out of there.	2.0
I normally don't review chain restaurants but it has to be done this time. I haven't been to a Red Lobster in years, but my parents insisted we go. One meal and I can now understand why Americans have an obesity problem. We got onion rings for an appetizer they were DRENCHED in oil and the onion part of the onion rings was no where to be found. Now I know someone who orders onion rings isn't too concerned with the nutritional value of food, but still I must draw the line somewhere. We got a shrimp combination platter. The fried shrimp weren't as oily but had WAY TOO much salt on them. The linguine was creamy to the extent that even I, a cheese enthusiast, found it be overwhelming. I ordered the flounder stuffed with crab for my dad, which was actually decent but still a bit on the greasy side. The salad that came with our entrees was drenched in dressing. While our server was nice I really think the cook needs to be spoken to. I'm all about indulging and enjoying a little butter/oil/ extra cheese in my food but COME ON ?? The highlight of the meal was of course the small biscuits they give in the beginning. I have no idea if this Red Lobster is an anomaly or if they have all transformed into an artery clogging conglomerate, regardless I will not be going to one ever again.	2.0
So far we have waited 39 minutes for our food. But they took money off meal for the lateness. The food was ok. I"m sure you can find better seafood than just ok somewhere else.	2.0
Service so so  food over cooked and dry Nothing was good	1.0
I am not a fan of this place. I went for a run in the snow and wanted to get some dinner. Not much else was open. They chucked me out for not having an id on me. Foods not worth it anyway. Won't be back	1.0
It's a great place to hang out after work.  Once I even saw a baby - in the bar.  The food is mediocre at best if you can motivate the wait staff to bring it out to you in a timely fashion.  I remember one night the flighty waitress served me a 16oz pour in a 10oz glass and was confused when I asked her about the glass size.   Ok...so the food is meh, the staff kinda sucks and they don't let you taste a wee bit of the craft beer before committing to a few of em? This place is really for locals swilling beers after work sitting and standing around the bar. DO NOT go there for dinner.	1.0
I got rejected, actually I got kicked out, because of my foreign Nationality. Very In-dignifying.	1.0
Annoying place. Unfortunately, I live right around the corner. Food is average. Nothing to write home about. Beer selection is excellent. Problem: the hipster crowd and staff - annoying at best. Worse though, they're racists - ironically. They wouldn't take a FOOD order because one of us did not have ID. Call me crazy but last time I checked I do not need an ID to order food and water. Guess we were a little too dark for country bumpkin East PA Blondie gone Philly Hipster. Needless to say, they won't get business from me or anybody I know.	1.0
The food here is always sub par and seems to be getting worse. Some simple seasoning, salt and pepper can go a long way. It's unfortunate because the beer and servers are great.	1.0
its rough to have the word local in a business name when it is so clear that they do not actually welcome locals. this is a total college bar.	1.0
I won't be returning to Local 44. Went to order dinner to go. Chose the catfish. How could you possibly mess up catfish? By getting something that's NOT catfish! Called to ask what kind of fish they used and was told it's definitely catfish and was hung up on! Took a picture of it. You be the judge, but this neither looks nor tastes like any catfish I've ever had! Ended up throwing it away. Just disgusting :(	1.0
been here a few times, and each time i go, i like it less. i think yesterday was the last straw. here's the good part about Local 44: they have excellent, quaffable beers.  hard-to-find beers that have been culled from all corners to provide a curated-beer experience.  not many places can offer that in West Philly. now the bad: the crowd.  basically what has already been said.  a mixture of the smarmiest students UPenn has to offer, a few neighborhood hipsters, and many, many yuppie couples talking about home remodeling.  you can, however, mostly avoid this by going in the early afternoon, when it's a bit quieter. the food.  truly awful.  i've worked my way through about half of the menu, and it's terrible, not only for a Belgian-style beer spot, but even for a dive bar serving the greasiest pub food (and trust me, that would be preferable).   not even the fries come close.  disclaimer: i  haven't had the hamburger, which some folks swear by, but if it's like anything else . . . yikes.   the no-sample policy.  here's one i wasn't aware of until yesterday.  having ordered probably close to 40-50 beers here, i wanted to try a new one.  i asked the bartender if i could try one of the pours, and she told me that they "don't do samples."  really?  here's a clue: you're a place specializing in obscure artisinal/microregional drinks.  not everyone's going to know how to parse the pithy 2-word descriptions into a realistic understanding of how the thing actually tastes.  and you're expecting them to pony up $7-12 for aforesaid beverage?  these aren't beers one has to "open," mind you.  these are keg- or cask-pours.  all i need is a 1/2oz., hell, even a 1/4oz. sample.  trust me, if i like it, i'll be buying 2 or 3 pints.  i've worked at two bars very similar to Local 44's apparent style, and sampling was a matter of business.  it INCREASED business.  i've also worked at high-end delis and cheese shops where we sampled $50-per-pound items all the time.  that's just what you do.   it's a smart model.  it's a no-brainer. what a stupid policy. i will not be returning.	1.0
I really want to like this bar. I am a fan of Resurrection / MTR / Strangelove's and wish that the same attention and effort would be put into this place. Instead, the food is inconsistent, the service more so, and too often I get short pours from the bar.This is just disappointing. It seems like they are skating by on the endless supply of undergrads/grad students looking to drink and the fact that are no other gastropubs in the immediate area with which they have to compete. The result is that once every few months someone suggests trying 44 - to see if it's any better or because we are just to lazy to walk any farther. When it isn't, this intensifies the anger and annoyance that this place isn't as good as it could be and, therefore, the amount of time that passes before we will consider going back again. Meh.	2.0
A few good beers on the menu, but the staff was rude and pretentious.	2.0
I went a couple weeks ago on a Saturday night to have a drink with a friend. We ran into a couple we knew and took over their bar table when they left. The bartender was really rude and took a LONG time to serve us. She looked pretty pissed off and in a bad mood. My friend and I finished our beers and patiently waited for her to come around and ask us if we wanted another, but she never did. I ended up going to the bartender behind the bar and getting more drinks from him to put on our tab. Really put off by the crappy service. I don't care if she had tattoos. She sucked. I only rated this two stars because the beer selection is good and decently priced.	2.0
The food is average (although they have quite a number of vegan options) and the beer list is extensive, but the staff are rude, offhand and unhelpful. Local 44 is fine if you just want to grab a quick beer but I would not recommend it for a meal. There are plenty of better places to dine in the area.	2.0
I reallly want to love this place, and give it 5 stars, i really do... it's in a great location, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is just right for this West Philly, neighborhood bar... However, the food here is horrible, and too expensive for how horrible it is. The Mac and cheese (for $12) is tasteless, has the weirdest texture, and I wonder if there's actually anything resembling cheese in it at all. The vegan Mac and cheese is even worse, and I needed to dump half a bottle of Siracha in it to be able to consume it. The fries are no better, they look like they scraped the bottom of the fryer to get them, most bits are over fried and too small to dip in ketchup. Do yourself a favor, drink the beer here, but eat before you come.	2.0
I'm sad. I hoped for better, especially after a few visits this spring.  Attentive staff, good beer (heavy on heavy, especially in cold weather), quirky food then.  It was beginning to make WPhilly look like a real place to eat and drink.  Prices are up there a bit, and this review is based upon an establishment that is charging max dollars and should be expected to be providing very good, if not excellent, service and product. After the last visit, we're done.  They no longer have the truly capable, beer guru bartenders during the day.  I guess she's just a warm body to fill space.  I understand just starting a shift, but when the only folks at the bar have to pointedly ask for another beer, there's a problem.   Their selection of beers is fascinating.  However, unusual product needs explanation.  Since many of the beers available were not on the descriptive menu, and the bartender was (see above), a couple of our selections weren't on target.  At prices up to $56 per gallon, it's expected that the beer comes with good advice, some helpful hints, a little taste to help with choosing, something.  Current reality:  *sound of crickets* I'm not thrilled with the menu change...there's a total lack of inspiration...but I didn't eat.  Maybe their falafel is garbonzo nirvana.  We used to like to eat here ,but the current selections won't bring us back to try it out. So, unless you don't have trolley fare, there's no reason to pay Center City prices to get W Philly treatment.  I hope that they'll pick up the dropped ball soon and straighten this out.  If not, I bet Jack Gillespie would love a Mill Creek North.	2.0
The Good: A wide selection of beers. High quality pub food. Fun atmosphere when it's relatively empty. The Bad: None of the beers are beers you've ever heard of before, and they don't have a sampler, plus the descriptions are extremely minimal, so you buy about four or five beers before you actually find one you like. When it's crowded, this place is awful. Like imagine dying and going to a hell manned by hipster demons. Something about the way the space is used makes it hot, sweaty, and unmanageable if crowded. Also, if anyone working at Local 44 reads these, please please please put better descriptions of your beer on your menus. If you're going to have random ass beers only, at least give me a good idea of what I'm getting into. Four words is not enough. Either that, or offer a standard choice or two.	2.0
Yesterday was Local 44's sixth anniversary. That gave me a reason to think about how it's changed since it opened. I lived around the corner then. I was delighted, the food was great, service was personal, and the atmosphere convivial--I gave them five stars then. It continues to be the only gastropub in the neighborhood. Perhaps some competition would have helped them maintain that quality. Six years have taken their toll. The food seems an afterthought now. Over the last year, I've had one too many meals where the food has been undercooked. Nevermind that the kitchen seems incapable of cooking a burger to temperature. It doesn't matter what you ask for, it's always rare. The bigger problem is chicken. Twice I ordered fried chicken, and thrice it was visibly undercooked (I sent it back the first time and the replacement was also undercooked--I settled for a salad). Its slow descent south of mediocrity has cost the neighborhood one of its treasures. Alas.	2.0
Hm, Local 44... I live approximately 45 seconds from the front door of Local 44, so I go semi-frequently. My feelings on the establishment are pretty complicated, though. They have the drinking side of the business down. The beer list is ever-changing and broad, the drinks are reasonably priced for what they are, Quizzo is fun, and so on. The food, however, is the definition of hit-or-miss. I've had some really tasty burgers and sandwiches here. They've also served me some of the worst and weirdest items I've ever encountered at a restaurant, though. A chickpea salad aggressively spiced with raw, dusty curry powder  and sopping with mayonnaise. Boiled peanuts that tasted like muddy water. A very strange and unfortunate bowl of gnocchi. And more. I've learned things tend to go wrong at Local 44 when they get adventurous with the seasoning or depart from traditional bar fare. So, I don't know. This and City Tap House and Dock Street are pretty much the choices in this neck of the woods when it comes to craft beer bars with mid-scale food. Out of the three, I'd toss out City Tap because it's expensive, and I would choose Local 44 to drink and Dock Street to eat. This review is a little pointless, because if you're the target demographic for Local 44 and you live in the neighborhood, you'll find yourself going there anyway from time-to-time. And everyone else in the city seems to think that 44th and Spruce is the boonies, so they wouldn't come out here anyway. Hmph. In sum, I can't really recommend it, but I know you'll end up here regardless. How's that for bleak?	2.0
Was really looking forward to trying one of the vegan sandwich options here, but I didn't even get the chance. My boyfriend and I had been seated when we were told we couldn't order food because we're under 21. The waitress was apologetic but this is some pretty important information which I would have appreciated knowing before going out of my way to come here. It could have been written SOMEWHERE (on yelp, on the menu, even on the door). Extremely frustrating experience.	1.0
I am native Philadelphian, lived in many sections of the city and 44 could be a gem, but started to quickly go down hill. My husband and I live walking distance and frequent the shops along 44th street often. I've been to 44 abour 4 times, with varoius groups of friends the food is never consistant, I can't say I've  ever had good dish there. Food is burnt,  tasteless or undercooked.  So dark you can't even see your food and waitresses always seem annoyed.  Really dispointing :(. I hope it changes, would love to support the local businesses.	2.0
It'd be a while since I'd been here and though it had never stuck out as a favorite to me, it always seemed decent enough. My most recent visit the food was quite good, but there was something more than a little off with the Bloody Mary's. We had already had a previous round of drinks when we ordered three of these guys. They came with a dark liquid floating on top which we later identified as Yard's Love Stout. I'm down with whatever weird stuff restaurants want to do as long as it works, but in this case it didn't. All three of us, who either are currently, or have been bartenders in respected restaurants, tasted what seemed like balsamic vinegar as the dominant flavor. Every sip was accompanied by a cringe. We got the attention of our server who had already been a little cool with us, but we nicely explained the situation. She said she would check what she could do and so began a chain of three different people explaining to us that as "there were no other complaints" they couldn't do anything and that we could "order it differently next time." One server told me that "beer is always in Bloody Mary's" as another justification....false. The manager explained that she didn't have comping powers, so we should just grin and bear it. I don't understand how that's possible, but if it's not another beer-is-always-in-Bloody-Mary's type lie, that is an egregious restaurant policy. Either way, they could have offered to simply remix the drinks and try to cut the vinegar taste in some way. Any gesture of good faith would have been appreciated. Side note - wonder what their solution would have been if one of us was gluten free. Anyway, if you don't mind eye rolls with your service and you like a little masochism with your Bloody Mary's this is the place for you. You just better be prepared to pay for any of their mistakes, as this restaurant does not seem to be concerned with customer service.	1.0
I finally decided to try local 44 after passing it many times. I like the decor of the bar. It has that trendy hipster dive bar feel thats real popular these days around the northern liberties area. The food was a huge let down. I had the fish and chips. The chips were go but the fish was terrible. Also the buffalo wings are flavorless and require blue cheese to get any sort of enjoyment out of them. My lady had the general tofu chicken. This was better than my meal but nothing special. Our server seem to have an attitude every time she walk up. Of course when the check came she wants to be all smiles. I do not recommend this place. If you want a good gastro pub as that's what I'm told these places are called I recommend going to northern liberties and trying north third.	2.0
Why do I try to come here again EVER!?!??!! Get this-  so they have NO PRICES on the beer menu, but they also DON'T GIVE SAMPLE POURS!!!!!! So just go ahead and get a beer you don't know is $15 and not even be able to sample it.  SUCK IT, LOCAL 44!!!!	1.0
We had only ordered water and were still IDed. Food selection was ok, but minimal. Service was the highlight - fast, friendly and knowledgable. When we got our food we were both really disappointed with it. I would go back for drinks, but I won't ever order any food from them again. Very over priced for the quality.	2.0
Went back yet again -- this time with my kids because a friend wanted to meet there for dinner. This time I ate, which was A HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I had the General Tso's Tofu, which consisted of 90% rice, 8% breaded and fried tofu, and 2% greens, covered in a sauce that tasted like salty corn syrup. Also weird that in this neighborhood, where you can't step outside without tripping over a wee one, there's no kids' menu. Grrrrrr. Also, since my last update, covering just the beer and complaining that the bartenders never serve a full pint, one of the owners sent a message saying: ***"We do serve our beers with an inch of head for the sake of presentation and aromatics."*** Problem is: THAT ISN'T A PINT. That's 12 oz (thebeergauge.com). If "an inch of head" is important to you (and, frankly, it should only be if you're drinking a stout), then the owner should purchase larger glasses -- glasses that allow a full pint of beer with some room at the top. It all comes down to this: the General Tso's Tofu aka Bowl of Rice, the middling beer pours --- this place is cutting every possible corner it can. Anything to get folks to pay for something they're not getting. How is that not insulting? (Let's not even talk about how their bottle shop is the only beer take-out shop in the neighborhood not to include tax in the sticker price.) But, really, I'm the butt of this joke. I love beer, Local 44 usually has at least one good IPA on tap, & it's around the corner -- so I hate it but I keep coming back.	2.0
It's pretty amazing that Local 44 has managed to get a 2 star review from me, given that I actually really like the atmosphere, the food, the excellent beer selection - and the location can't be beat at 2.5 blocks from my house. However, I feel driven to warn people that this place has outstandingly rude service. It's been getting progressively worse. The most recent time I went there, I was was with a group of 5. The dining room was empty, it was after 9 on a weeknight, and three of the five of us wanted to eat. My friend asked for a table and they asked pointedly if EVERYONE in our party was going to eat, and then refused us a table "in case it got busy". After the two friends who were not eating decided to leave, I asked the hostess for a table again, and made a point of saying "There are three of us who would like to eat. Would it be possible for us to get a table?" Mind you, dining room still basically empty, while the bar section was packed full. She asked me, "Is everyone going to get an ENTREE?" Admittedly, at this point I lied and said yes so we could sit down. One of us ended up getting a salad, one of us got an appetizer, and one of us got an entree. At most restaurants, this would be an acceptable order - I wound up wondering if they would be mad at us for not all getting entrees. This is the second or third time I've gone there and they've refused to seat my group. As per usual when you go to a neighborhood bar, I'm basically always with a group where some people want to eat and some just want to drink. I don't go too frequently, we're not rude or rowdy, we're just normal people who want to hang out and have dinner and drinks with friends. I would be fine with a "Parties that aren't getting food can't have a table" policy, or even a "At busy times, everyone has to get food" policy. But for a place that seems to want to project the image of a friendly neighborhood bar, a policy of "We won't seat your party in our empty dining room unless EVERY person buys an ENTREE" is absurd. The rudeness with which the hostess lays out this policy is also uncalled for. I would be a regular patron of this bar if they would just be polite to customers, because again, I love the food, the beer, and the atmosphere [except the servers].	2.0
The food isn't as good as it used to be.  Put waaaay too much pepper in the fries.	2.0
The beer is great here, and the servers/bartenders know their brews and what you might like, as well. Got great recommendations. The food, however, is not my cuppa. Definitely not a "gastropub" or even a place where, if drunk, I'd want to order any food at all. Though their menu is bold, the tastes were bland or overseasoned, and the prices for such low quality were laughable. I will go here when it's not overcrowded, endeavor not to sit in the super dark and grim interior, and have a beer. Maybe.	2.0
Where can you go on a glorious Sunday morning and get ambushed, upon entry by two different staff people, talking to you at the same exact time, saying completely different things? Why, Hop on over to Local 44. I was immediately transported to my trip here 6 months ago, where I ordered the wings which were cold and raw inside. Still, I stupidly let my husband convince me that this was worth another shot.   11:35, my husband and  I enter and the aforementioned incident happened. We request a table and 15 minutes later, a server asks us if we want a table. Hmm, interesting, the same person we requested from. 11:50 we sit a a high top table that has a bunch of miscellaneous crap on it (a tower of plastic cups, a few dirty glasses, and crumpled napkins. 11:55  the owner I believe asks me if we want him to clear the table. He goes back to drinking with a few of other friends, and then comes and clear the table. 12:05 We get menus and then the server aforementioned informs us that another table is available and we should move. 12:10 We sit at new table and are greeted by two different waitresses (fine, no biggie) 12:15 we get water, and another waitress comes over 12:30 we order french toast and a sandwich--waitress takes order and then smartly the waitress asks my husband and I for Id's. I laugh it off, the irony is that my 28th birthday is tomorrow and I had a major hangover from the night before, and I haven't been carded in a while, and i left my passport home. I say sorry, don't have my ID we're not ordering alcohol and after almost an hour in this place she says "Just run home, if you don't live far--sorry, it's our policy. I think to myself, that's interesting, at any point in this 50 minute ordeal we could have run back to the car to get an id, especially when we were offered seats at the bar, and inherited a table with half full beer glasses, etc. But no, not at local 44.	1.0
How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways... Actually it's a waste of my time to be creative in trashing this place, so enough of the faux poetics. I really wanted this place to be awesome, but for me it just isn't. If you like to be treated poorly with your good food and great beer then this is the place. I've been four times, just to give it a fair shot and because I wanted to be wrong, but nope, it sucks. I just don't enjoy being scolded or yelled at for ordering a burger at the wrong time or having an incorrect number of people at a table to maximize the profits of the business. Maybe you're cool with that, perhaps things have changed, or most likely I'm a kook. Try it out if you like, but the most positive thing I've ever heard is that it's the best available option in the neighborhood, or that you just put up with the attitude to get the food and beer, a soupnazi kinda thing. I've decided on a self-imposed lifetime 86 from this place and I've extended that to the Memphis Taproom and Resurrection Ale House too, same owners, even though I have heard good things about them. There are other places to spend my money. I go to Fiume, just around the corner, or get food at the various restaurants within a block of this place. All in all I'd rather it go back to Kelliann's, the rather lowbrow former occupant of this corner.	1.0
Local 44 used to have solid food, if somewhat overpriced for the neighborhood. The various French fry and mac-n-cheese preparations were practically unparalleled, and you always knew that you could find something on the menu that sounded good. In September 2012, Local 44 hired its first executive chef. Based on the results, this appears to have been a move to go a little more upscale and creative with the menu. Instead, it's been a bit of a disaster. Almost every item on the menu has changed since September, as the well-prepared pub food has given way to more conceptual items. Many entrees cater to vegetarians and vegans, which would be fine if it didn't seem to be crowding out the typical pub fare. Worryingly, the menu seems to change almost weekly. I don't think that this is so much a seasonal/fresh ingredients change so much as the executive chef is trying to find the right combination of quirky and accessible. I don't think that he's hit it yet because ironically, that would mean going back to the old menu. As a result of the menu turbulence, I am no longer confident that there will be good food when I go to Local 44. The ambience and the beer selection continue to be fine, but there's no longer a sense of stability in the food. Before the changes, Local 44 was a good option for any given outing in West Philadelphia. However, since the onset of the revolving door menu the only thing that keeps me coming back is the weekly trivia, which is unparalleled in the City of Philadelphia. As the trivia has locked me into Local 44, I hope each week that the owners and the executive chef will return to the original concept of doing normal pub food in a creative, well-executed fashion.	2.0
Used to love this spot. Great concept, but dropping the ball on delivering that concept. Love the beer selection, but they refuse to give you a taster.   They tell me that is because they keep their beer prices low.  First of all, their beer prices are not low.  Second of all, a two ounce pour once in a while from a keg that  is going to generate over $1,000 of profit is not going to change the margin that significantly.  Third of all, I don't feel like paying $7 for a beer to find out that I hate it. Food is decent, but it is hard to get a table, so often I have left and ventured elsewhere. Noise level is way too high and needs to be addressed. There are too many places nearby that offer better service, better food and better atmosphere	1.0
Local 44's slogan for all intents and purposes is: "gastropub. We kind of hate that word." Don't worry though, Local 44, no one will ever accuse you of being one of those if the definition of gastropub is "an establishment that serves food of quality higher than poor." Seriously, I get that you want the emphasis on the beer not the food, but it is actually possible to have a decent rotating beer selection and at the same time offer food that isn't utter crap for people to enjoy while drinking it. (News flash: People like to eat while drinking!) Around late summer, we heard that there was going to be a new chef and hoped for a menu that wasn't 80% deep fried (Black bean burger? That's gonna be deep fried. BOOM! You're welcome) but somehow the food managed to get even worse since. One evening my husband and I stopped in for a drink and snack -- he got the new bone marrow appetizer and I got the grilled shrimp cocktail, $9 and $8 respectively. OK, first of all, there was MAYBE a full tablespoon of marrow in my husband's dish and my "grilled" shrimp cocktail consisted of lukewarm, clearly microwaved, previously frozen shrimp like the kind that comes in the shrimp ring at Pathmark, sitting on top of a sloppy bed of cloyingly sweet ketchup-heavy "cocktail" sauce and -- WAIT FOR IT -- covered in lettuce. THE. HELL? We also stopped in for a perfectly serviceable brunch on New Year's Day which was fine, I guess, other than the fact that it took an entire for our food to come out after we ordered it. On the last point, and I do realize what I'm saying here, but the wine selection also has much to be desired, especially for the $8-$9 per 70's style small goblet that they charge for it. I get it, I get it -- again, it's a beer bar. However, I have stomach sensitivity when it comes to beer and I don't think it's too much to ask that my husband and I can go someplace where he can have a good craft beer and I can have a nice glass of wine, as we can countless other beer-centric places in the city -- Johnny Brenda's, Prohibition, Memphis Taproom, POPE, to name a few. It's just disappointing that Local 44 is really the only place we have like this in West Philly, and it's not, well, "better." C'mon guys... Can't you set the bar just a bit higher?	2.0
I don't often find myself in this part of the city. although there are many good spots. This is definitely a good spot! 2 stars? Service issue. I arrived here with a friend and just had to wait a few minutes. It was a weekend evening. The server was super nice, explaining the beer list and offering recommendations. The food was excellent! I had the unexpectedly good General Tso's Tofu. The heat in the dish actually kicked my ass a little. In a good way. I noticed throughout the meal that we were checked on way too frequently. This turned into being rushed. The servers also were ducking out of the way to let others pass REALLY CLOSE TO MY TABLE and it was distracting because of the frequency of them checking in the other times. They were very reachy and grabby with the glasses. It was obvious people were waiting to get a table but that doesn't mean rush the diners who are seated. It does here. It's a great spot! I just hope that this isn't the norm with their servers.	2.0
Honestly, I have tried to like this place. I live a few blocks away and went there at least 5 times hoping, wanting, wishing that things would change. Nope. The service is not good. My boyfriend and I watched an entire room get served and leave before our order was brought to us, and all we ordered was eggs and toast. Every time I have been here, similar experience. Long wait time, inattentive staff, lackluster food. It is also WAY out of it's league as far as prices go...subtract about 4 dollars from everything on the menu and you are closer to where you should be. I won't waste my time coming here again, especially with the plentiful options elsewhere.	2.0
Great taps, but that's Philly. Food/Brunch: Better show those IDs for that pancake or be prepared to be told to go to hell! Smarmy dude will kick you out if you don't have your ID. Conversation will go something like this: You: "My ID? I'm not drinking" Him: You need your ID anyway, in case you couldn't tell this is actually a bar. (he's gets really proud of himself at this line) You: Hey, thanks for pointing out this is a bar I had no idea! Him: Hey, its not us, its Philly! Really! You: Really? I find that hard to believe. I'm having trouble remembering the last time I had brunch in Philly in a place that wasn't a bar. Can you even tell me a brunch place that's not a bar? Him: No, but Philly created special laws just for us and we're just following them! We swear this isn't our own awful managerial policy! You: Hey, what about that person over there with their kid, did the child show an ID? Him: No, he's in the in crowd and a regular, you're not, go to hell (or at least to city taproom). Law's the law!	2.0
I really want to like this place. A.) It's close by B.) The outside and inside ambiance are so gosh-darn cute and cozy. C.) Who doesn't love a local pub?! The beer selection is great and is what brings me back in every so often... but the food is just ok, but not good, and certainly not great. At times very over priced for what it is. I've been a few times over the past year or two and the staff are overly cocky and pretentious, with the exception of some of the bar tenders.	2.0
WTF dudes, seriously? You're the only game in town & you fail miserably. Surly staff? Check. Pretentious hop-heavy draft list? Check. Shitty policy where I have to vacate the dining room as soon as I'm  finished my meal? Check. But you're a block away from my house. And your greasy brunch is decent (edit - although the last time we were there, I ordered my eggs over easy & they came out with the edges burnt & the yolks solid - c'mon chef, that's rude) . And your bartender on the weekends during the day rules. Seriously, that dude is the man. They recently acquired an executive chef. Pretty fancy for a bar that vehemently denies being a gastropub, eh?  Well... Get rid of him. He effed up your menu. The only reason I go to your bar (besides for a hang-over curing brunch) is for a Walt Wit and the seitan Ruben. What the eff did that guy do to it??!! A Ruben is: a heaping mound of corned beef (vegan or otherwise), sauerkraut, Russian dressing & rye bread. And that's what you served. And it was amazing. Now it's 3 slices measly of seitan, some nasty red cabbage bullshit, overly vinegary mustard and soggy pumpernickel.  BRING BACK THE OG RUBEN! Vegetarian/Vegans love simple/comfort food too! My bf had the General Tso tofu hoagie, and normally he's a LOVER of the General. He said this tasted like lemon Smartees - not a good thing & not Tso-y at all. Another in our group had the salmon BLT. The salmon looked like it came out of an Oscar Mayer package. Get it together! Good food is simple food. And get some damn bourbon mayonnaise or aioli for your fries. It's 2012....	2.0
Unforgettable first time here: I went with 3 friends. Both my roommate and I order fish tacos. The wait for our entrees goes from 'longer than average' to long to 'let's start thinking about leaving'. Wen we had questions about our order status and wait time, the waitress was nowhere to be found. And plus,what can she do about the fact that they ran out of soft taco shells and someone had to...wait for it...leave the kitchen to buy more. I don't know. Maybe someone could've told us. We aren't addicted to fish tacos or anything. That was 2 years ago. Bad customer service memories linger and are repeated to friends. As for the food, it was unremarkable.	1.0
They have a good beer selection here but I was not too impressed with the food. I ordered the brat sandwich. It was kind of pedestrian.	2.0
Ok, so. I like this place. The beer list is generally awesome, even if it is impossible to read from your table. But, do not eat here. I ordered fish and chips, and got the soggiest, most tasteless, inedible fish I've ever seen. After 2 or 3 bites I asked the waitress if I could order something else, since it was awful, and she said that she could refry the same pieces of fish if I wanted, but that's the best she could do unless I just wanted to order something else (and pay for both dinners). I told her nevermind, and didn't eat one more bite of my meal. It came with burnt hushpuppies that I could barely break in half, and had no desire to eat. When the check came, I asked if there was anything we could do about the $12 charge since I didn't eat my dinner. She argued with me, essentially told me that it was my fault that it was so bad (clearly, I let it sit on the table too long...folks, make sure you jump up and make an immediate scene in this establishment if you need to send something back to the kitchen...), and said she offered to fix it. I told her refrying the same bad fish is not fixing it, and she continued to argue. I told her nevermind and she stormed off tantrum-style. It was an unfortunate experience, and I will not be eating here again.	1.0
Local 44 is one of the nearby establishments that my girlfriend and I have wanted to visit for some time, but haven't for one reason or another. We spent New Years Day at Local 44 and decided to see what the brunch fare offered - upon being carded at the door, we settled at a small table near the bar. I decided upon chicken and dumplings and my girlfriend ordered an Irish cheesesteak (specials offered during New Years Day). Other reviewers have noted that service could be sloooooow, especially on weekends. I mentally kept note of when we ordered and we both ordered a craft brew for $8 a glass. As people filtered in, it was easy to spot the regular patrons - a nod or handshake was all that was required to get in without being carded, a benefit of being a regular. As some patrons sat at the bar and placed their orders, we had been waiting 30 minutes for our food. Huh. Ten minutes later, out comes some food; one cheesesteak! My girlfriend's foo...huh? It went to the patrons who ordered 30 minutes after us? Two minutes later, more food is served, and we finally get our food, as do the other customers who arrived after us. Maybe they cook food in batches, or being a regular certainly has benefits? Local 44 definitely has a vibe that fits in with University City/West Philly, and they have a broad spectrum of beers, but avoid their brunch menu. The food may be ok/somewhat tasty, but be prepared to wait a good length of time before you eat. We may return on the next leap year, after this month.	2.0
This review applies only to brunch. Never been here for drinks or dinner. Much of the menu is vegan. Which is strange, because they also have hamburgers. I ordered the French toast, which came with a side of vegan sausage (felt like something straight out of a Morningstar box, but I could be wrong). But French toast typically has eggs. So what's the point of serving a vegan side? Anyway, this French toast lacked the custardy bite that good French toast requires. I wonder whether they even soaked the toast in eggs+cream because it tasted like the bread was merely pan fried with butter. Also, real maple syrup would've been nice. I appreciated the apple kraut on the side though. Service is friendly, but the place seems seriously understaffed!	2.0
Good beer selection and great happy hour prices ($3 per pint); Food was sub-par and portions (I had the fish and chips) were small.  I even asked waitress what happened to the rest of my fish-- I only had 1 and a half pieces.  She was not concerned and said it was weighed out appropriately (said this without looking down at my plate; she in fact never saw it since a food runner brought out my food).  Not impressed.	2.0
#268 Definitely a bit of an experience getting here, but it's a nice little place in University City. I can't remember my food at all so I'm just going to chalk that up to its quality. But, I did enjoy the ambiance where several friends and I imbibed over our brunch and chatted the morning away. Nothing special though.	2.0
I've loved this bar since it opened, we live a block away and it's always been nice to have a great late night stop nearby.  Last night we stopped by at 11:30pm to grab a quick bite.  I ordered their pumpkin mac & cheese, which I've had before and loved.  When it came, though, it was dry... not more than noodles with chunks of pumpkin.. no cheese in the mac & cheese.  When I pointed that out to our waitress, she first lectured me for using the word "cheese" since the meal was vegan and the "cheese" is really a non-dairy sauce.  Then she offered to take it back and have the chef "pour some more stuff on it?"  We had ordered other food, so I said no and we ate our other dishes. When she came back to our table, she asked if she could wrap up the pumpkin mac & cheese.  I said, no, I just wanted it taken off the bill since I didn't eat it.  She dropped the plate back on the table and told me nothing was wrong with the food so there was no way she could take it off the bill & she could either go get sauce or I could take it home.  I was really shocked.  We come to this bar all the time & I've never been treated with such contempt. The situation escalated, I paid for the whole meal, including the infamous mac & cheese, tipped her well and we left.  But I will never go back.  As much as I like the food, I just don't need to pay to be treated like that. It's too bad that Local just lost a local.	1.0
If this place were a little farther west and had decent food it would be a godsend to the beerdrinkers of my neighborhood. The beer is terrific and the room is nice. Unfortunately the food is pretty awful and the bro quotient is a little high. This is one of very few places to choose from if you want to meet a friend in the neighborhood for a quality beer. And for that it is fine. But if you're looking for a place to eat dinner and/or strike up an interesting conversation with the person next to you at the bar, you will probably be disappointed.	2.0
I want to love this bar but it has failed me almost every time I have tried to eat here. I like to give a place a few tries before I completely write it off, as well as always giving servers the benefit (I worked in food service for years) but my last dining experience was the end. (I must inject that the bar tenders have always been fantastic, friendly and quite knowledgeable.) Their chaotic seating arrangements are hard to handle, and would be much better if the wait staff was just slightly more attentive to the people waiting. Almost every time I have gotten a seat and ordered, I have received short answers or bad attitude from the servers. During my last experience, my boyfriend and I were there for food only, and explained this to the waitress (who looked like she was in a rush) in order to help her out. She quipped that she still had to check our ID's and explained, sarcastically, the difference between a bar that serves food and a restaurant that serves drinks and how we didn't have a choice about showing our ID's. Great. This could have been explained in a polite way, or maybe even with some humor. Other great moments from different visits include our server walking away from our table after asking her about a type of beer they had on tap, snatching a menu out of my hand after ordering and not bringing us menus for about 20 minutes after seating us. It is a shame, because the red flannel hash that they serve during brunch is AMAZING.	1.0
After being excited at the opening of this fancy new bar, I now reminisce about the days of Kellians! Their beer is good, service is decent, food is WAAAY too expensive for what it is. $8-9 for a veggie burger? I also think it's really silly how they don't let folks sit at the tables if they're not ordering food. It's a friggin BAR for christ's sake, not a restaurant! I go there for a couple of beers before a night out, but that's about it for me. It just doesn't have the appeal that I thought it would. As someone mentioned above, I also agree that it doesn't have a 'soul'. I miss the dart boards and the pool table that Kellian's used to have. It was the only bar nearby that I could go and drink and always get in a game of pool. I miss the normal but decent selection of beer AND liquor. I also miss the cheap-o, but tasty food that was made by that creepy-but-charming older lady that was always in the kitchen. I miss being allowed to go out back to smoke. Also, there was always an interesting mix of people from old heads to college students..not the primarily yuppified crowd I tend to see in there nowadays. Sorry, Local 44..but you're just not doing it for me.	2.0
I live a block away and I wanted to LOVE this place and thought I'd be here all the time.  I was SO excited when they opened - a new bar a block away, something different than Kelliann's bar (typical dive bar) that was here before. Ate here again for the 10th or so time, and every time we dine here, I wonder why we do - probably because it is a block away and we are in the mood for a beer and some good tavern food.  They keep changing the menu (not for the better) and each time you go, the one or two good items you may have experienced before are gone.  Had the pork tacos - they were awful, bland with no sauce or anything.  A few months ago the recipe was different and they were quite good, so if you're looking forward to a dish you had before - don't get your hopes up.  The only positive on the food front is the fries have improved greatly from when the place opened. My husband loves beer and so for him this place is more solid, but I am not always in the mood for beer.  Last time I was there I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine. They offer wine but the wine I was served was old and probably was opened several days ago.  I even asked them to switch me to another wine as the one they poured me tasted funny, the second one was actually worse.  I can understand that they are not a wine bar and their focus is beer, and I'm fine with them only offering 6 wines.  Heck, cut it to 3 and make them decent!!   When you open a bottle it shouldn't sit around for awhile - wine does go bad. Don't offer a crappy product just to say you've got it on the menu.  That is probably what annoyed me the most.  I'll sit home and drink my $10 bottle of wine versus your awful, old, $8 glass of wine. Pros: Only place like it in the neighborhood, large selection of craft beers. Cons: Service mediocre, wine is awful, food average at best. A small, cramped space that is for some reason, subdivided into two areas making it even smaller and more cramped.  Can't sit in the dining area and watch the TV - important if you're there for the game.	2.0
I really wanted to like this place. I really did. However, my food was really disappointing even though I wanted to convince myself otherwise as I was swallowing it. It's awfully close to where I used to live, so I wanted to give it a try. I got a beer, and I shared a veggie burger and an empanada. The beer was okay. The veggie burger was WAY to mushy. I understand if a veggie burger is slightly softer than your typical burger of the meat variety, but this biting into this veggie burger was like trying to eat a heap of refried beans on a giant oversized bun. Also, I think they charge extra for burger toppings like cheeses, which I personally am not a fan of. (I may be wrong about that though). The empanada was ehhh... The shell was okay. It was a little heavy, but it still managed to be somewhat crisp. The fillings, however, did not pass muster. The meat was a little overpowering, and it was dry. The cheese and the meat just did not mix well. It made for an awkward combination that could have otherwise been a good dish. The sauce that came with the empanada was great though!	2.0
Sadly, Local 44 has changed ownership and gone downhill.  The menu has changed (but not for the better), the wait staff is downright dopey (they don't ask about refills, they forgot about one of my party entirely).  I think they're sailing on the laurels of the previous owners...and their location (because they're the only game in this neighborhood).  I'm not going back - unless they change owners again.	2.0
after months of hearing fab things about this bar, i came to eat one night recently.  the beer selection is fantastic.  however if you're hungry, go somewhere else.  the food was mediocre at best.  the burger and fries- flavorless and my boyfriend's portobello sandwich really greasy.  we felt sick for several hours afterwards.   the bottom line. eat before you go drinking at local 44.	2.0
Food was greasy and not very flavorful. I had the portabello sandwich and my gf had a burger, which she thought wasn't very flavorful either. Plenty of beer. People were very friendly!	2.0
I just want to add to the other reviewer's comment on the no sampling policy. They also have a no returns policy. Over the summer I went out on a limb and tried one of their 'sour' beers. After the first sip, I thought it was skunked. It was awful. I told the waitress I thought it had gone bad, and she assured me that was what it was supposed to taste like. She said that that particular beer couldn't be returned, so clearly many others did not like it either. She instead "offered" to bring me something else, which I would also have to pay for. That's just bad customer service and bad policy. I've been back, but only reluctantly. Most of the food is only so so, however the fish and chips is really good.	2.0
This bar is managed by the same people who run the Memphis Taproom, one of my favorite bars in the city.  Despite this fact, and that L44 is 2 blocks away from my place, and that I love beer and pub food, I've only been here 4 times.  The reason why?  Compared to Memphis, the menu offers pretty slim pickings.  I'm vegetarian and I've gotten the mushroom po'boy and the veggie burger.  Both were ok, but nothing special. The real kicker about this place is their seating policy.  On two different occassions, I've shown up there with 4-8 people who wanted to get drinks.  Even at 11pm, they didn't want to seat us, claiming that they have to keep these (empty) tables for dining parties only.  We practically had to beg them to seat us, and promise to order fries if they did.  I can't think of another bar that would turn away a large, thirsty party because they're not eating, especially at that hour of night. The beers are good, and pretty affordable.  I really want to like this place, and to treat it like the local watering hole its supposed to be.  It should be like shooting fish in a barrel, since there are not alot of pubs like Local 44 in the area.	2.0
I feel that yelp's two star blurb "Meh, I've had better" very adequately describes my feelings for this place.  I was really excited to give it a try once I found that it was Memphis Taproom related.  This place is not nearly as good though.  For one thing, it's small.  When the two skinny girls at the table next to us left, my skinny boyfriend had to get up and push in his chair in so they could leave.  The sub-optimal seating arrangement would be forgivable if the food were good, but it wasn't anything special.  I got the veggie burger, two Boca burgers with avocado and pepper jack cheese on a roll that was 1/3 larger than the burgers.  I've had better at Bennigan's.  Toppings were a dollar each. What is this, Sketch?  If you're going to charge me Sketch prices, give me Sketch quality.  Or at least Memphis Taproom quality where they make their veggie burgers.  Fries were edible, but as Henry Miller said, "Americans can eat garbage, provided you sprinkle it liberally with ketchup."  None of the other vegetarian entrees looked very appealing to me.  If they change their menu seasonally, I might give it another try on the next rotation.  Boyfriend seemed okay with the food, but he was also bothered by the size of the place.  It was a Thursday night, but the Phillie's were playing, so by the time we left the place was packed.  I'd say I'd go back for brunch, because I love the Taproom's, but I really can't take anymore disappointment.	2.0
I rode my bike to west philly for THIS!? The service was REALLY REALLY REALLY CRAPPY.  I mean we were sat in the bar area for 20 minutes before anyone gave us our drinks.  Another 20 minutes before we could order food.    Food took a while as well.    Then when we asked for our check it took 15 minutes to get it.  It was really ridiculous.  HIRE MORE BARTENDERS.  I DO NOT WANT TO WAIT THIS LONG FOR SERVICE! At least when I got pissy at my friend for paying with a credit card, (I screamed in front of the bartender "Oh Great that will take another 20 fucking minutes") the bartender ran the card very quickly. The food was nothing special.  The sweet and sticky wings were very liquidy and drippy.  The mini corndogs were kind of cool though.   All in all this place is a big GD NO.	1.0
Local 44 might be closer to a 3 star, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to knock it down to 2 just to even out the insanely high ratings everyone else is yelping for this place. Yes, Local 44 is the best such bar of its type in West Philly-- but the best at what? Emulating a Northern Liberties bar? The service is fine, pretty neutral, and the beer selection is certainly there, but I find it to be a little pretentious and there's definitely some overpriced beers on tap.  Overall, I'd say if you're a beer fan then it'd be great to have Local 44, well, local to you, but it's not worth a special trip. I think my biggest disappointment is with the food. They seem to be trying to do something a little fancier than bar food but everything I've had has been generally overcooked and nothing special. Also, there aren't any happy hour specials on food. I think an important aspect of a "neighborhood bar" is a fair price on some halfway decent bar food and in that respect, Local 44 comes up short for me.	2.0
This place is always so packed.  And dark.  I like that they have interesting vegetarian options (I'm so sick of the obligatory veggie burger that's on most pub menus) but the food is just so greasy.  Even when I crave greasy pub food, this is just too much; I leave feeling sick.   I have to admit I'm not a beer drinker, so I know their huge beer list is a draw for some people, but my husband loves a good microbrew and this place is definitely never first on his list of places to go (he'd probably give it 3 stars). I prefer Dock Street any day.	2.0
So, after the owner read my review he messaged to tell me that he knows his beers and that I was wrong about their winter beer selection.  They have 5.  Out of 22 they have 5.  Large list of winter beers for January.   He also told me about his overpricing of the beers.  Basically it seems like he's charging us 10% extra to cover the taxes.  Seems odd and wrong to me. Neither of those things really bothered me about his emails.  He didn't really try to address the issue that is the main problem.  See, I have no problem paying extra for a beer at a place I enjoy going to, and if I do enjoy the place those 5 winter beers would suffice.  I'd be excited about going to a new spot to drink that's close to my house.  The real problem was the atrocious service I had.  I let him know I had the worst experience of my life at a bar.  I got much more into detail about my experience at his bar then I did here, and he didn't seem interested at all in rectifying the situation, or even acknowledging it.  Personally, I think he's a nice guy and does seem to know his beer, but he should learn to hire people.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say these people are his friends that he hired.  I get that impression because if they weren't his friends, maybe he would be inclined to be less stubborn about acknowledging the fact that I had a very bad experience at his bar.   Basically to make a long story short about my bad encounter at the Local 44, I was insulted by a waitress about my weight for ordering fries, but my skinny friend was not.  Furthermore I ordered fries to share with the table.  I wasn't even hungry.  I was brought my check before we were even finished eating and drinking and without asking for it.  We were asked to leave our table before finished eating, and the waitress told us that the customers were complaining because we were taking too long to finish.  We also had to flag people down to order.  I didn't enjoy it at all. I would avoid this place.  There isn't even a happy hour.  What kind of bar doesn't have a happy hour?  Check out the owners other spot, Memphis Taproom.  That's a solid bar, but the waitstaff here is amongst the worst in Philly, if not the worst.  If he restaffs then I'll make sure to give this place another shot, but until then I'm done.	1.0
Ordered Montclair blue burger, bacon cheese burger, and a blt.  Added fries to the burgers. Compared to elevation burger, smash burger, or zin burger I would put this burger at the back of the pack in terms of taste.  When you add a price tag of $31 for this take out order I don't see us going back.  I know grass fed is supposed to a big deal but at the end of the day it's still red meat.  Nobody ever says that antibiotic fed cows will kill you although it seems to be implied, and therefore justifies $9.50 for a burger. There is likely a market for high end burgers in Montclair, I just happen to not fit that mold.  If I am going to pay that much for a burger, I personally would prefer a real sit down experience  (stuffed has very limited seating) at any of the previously mentioned establishments.	2.0
The burgers weren't stuffed with enough cheese and were overcooked and chewy.  The lettuce and dressing on the salad was disgusting.  The mushrooms were seasoned well and were tasty.  The buns were okay.  The fries were really good but the food took a long time.  You had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom.	2.0
Went to check out Stuffed the other night and got a Montclair blue burger and the bacon jam fries to go. The burger was ok but way over done, they didn't ask me how I liked it cooked either when I ordered so maybe they just defaulted to well. Considering the price though I'd expect a bit better attention to detail. The fries were good though which gave it an extra star in itself. The service was ok, the person working the counter wasn't rude but just didn't seem to care to be there. Was hoping for more but they're new so hopefully it will only improve!	2.0
This place sucks!! My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place because we love sushi. We probably should have turned around and got back in our car when we walked in and saw the sushi chef playing with his kid on top of one of the tables. The place probably hasn't been vacuumed since the 70's and the fish seemed old too. We dint get plates I had to eat on a napkin. I can't even give this place a star.	1.0
I have been getting take-out from here for quite some time now. I like that you are able to order online and choose a time to come get the food. In the past, this has never been an issue. Christmas Eve, my office got out early, so I decided to order some lunch before all the Christmas Eve festivities started.  I placed on an online order around 1130am for a 115 pick-up. Around 1230 I get an urgent message from them, wondering where I was. I attempted to call the restaurant again and someone would pick-up and hang up. I did this 8 TIMES in a row. I even called their sister restaurant, Egg Roll Express and the same things happened. Around 1pm, I got another call from them, wondering where I was? I calmly told them that my online order had stated that I would be there at 115 and whomever was answering the phone there had no idea what they were doing. Given there is a language issue there, I gave up trying to tell them what happened. The sushi IS good, but if you are going to place an order for pick-up online, you better be prepared to pick it up within the hour. They obviously don't know how to use their online order system.	2.0
Decided to order delivery. One of my co-workers wanted sushi, so I chose to order with her. We never tried this place, so we gave it a shot since it got some decent reviews from our other co-workers. First of all, our food arrived a half hour later than when it was supposed to get here. When I got the call from the delivery driver that she was here, I went to get it and the woman was apologetic and nice. Totally different than talking to her on the phone where she sounded kind of cold-hearted and mean. A star for that. The food: We ordered the maki combos where you get 2 rolls and it comes with a miso soup. My co-worker ordered Boston rolls and I ordered a Spicy Tuna and a Shrimp Tempura roll. Now, the Boston roll was okay, but the shrimp inside it tasted not very fresh. It was very sour as if it had been dipped in lemon juice for days. The spicy tuna from the very moment you looked at it...was very unappealing. The tuna was dark red, purplish, and black. Doesn't sound fresh, does it? It wasn't. I had trouble eating that one, but I paid for it so I ate it anyway. I'm expecting a stomachache later. I'll probably be barfing and everything disgusting in the bathroom later. The second star was for the Eggplant miso and miso soup. Now, those were good. I'll have to try out their Chinese food, Egg Roll Express, next time. No sushi for me from here ever again, though. Go to a real sushi place if you want better sushi.	2.0
We grabbed take out here one night, it was late and our options are limited. When I placed my order I knew what I was getting myself into but when hunger calls you have a few options, starve or eat what is available. We ordered soup, a dragon roll I believe and a combo of some sort. I don't recall that is how insignificant the meal was. Octopus was rubbery and weird tasting. The soup was okay but nothing special. Sushi was edible, the quality being comparable to grocery prepared sushi. Value: Overpriced for the quality of food. Would I ever do it again? Next time I'm hungry I'm ordering a pizza. Note: the place looks very dirty inside. I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered from there.	2.0
I might be a fish and sushi whore, but even I have my limits. It was lunch time at work, and my coworkers wanted to order take out. I figured I have to try a place that delivers sushi!  The sushi didn't deliver.  I ordered tuna sashimi and a so called spicy tuna roll.  The fish was not fresh, the tuna roll was mostly mayo. The fish even looked old.  I love Sushi is connected to Egg Roll express, Chinese food, which is alright for Chinese takeout. I mean it's cheap greasy sodium laden food, which really isn't my thing.   I would recommend staying from the sushi from this place.	1.0
This restaurant is awful. The pub is even worse. Very unappetizing and not fresh looking, poor presentation and specials that really were not special...They try to change the special offers frequently because the business is doing so poorly. Be wary of some of the glowing reviews...I'm am reasonably sure they are of people that work there or are connected to the owners... Just awful...	1.0
My friend and I had dinner here last night. The soup and salad were very good, as was the wine, the service, and atmosphere. The problem was the game sampler and the sauerbraten dinner. The venison was very tough and so salty we couldn't eat it. The spatsle was hard and inedible , red cabbage was mushy. We were there the week before and the prime rib was not very good and the gravy was terrible. Very expensive for such bad entres. Too bad, because the people were nice and nice atmosphere.	2.0
Its okay, decent burgers and nachos and foods of that sort in the summer but nothing special, over priced average fancy food in winter, the outside area could use lots of new furniture, and the bar outside is nasty	2.0
Service is terrible and the food is bland. The pub needs a serious makeover and the acts that they have there sound awful.	2.0
My husband and I just tried this place tonight.  It looked nice; outdoor seating,  nice evening.  Has decent ratings here on Yelp. First off, the tables and chairs here are flimsy plastic.  Like they bought them at Walmart.   Thin, cheap forks and knives, plastic baskets were used for many dishes. Now the food.  My husband got an arugula salad with pears, goat cheese, walnuts and chicken.  It was the size of a side salad.  The single piece of goat cheese was the size of a grape.  My fish and chips were passable, if a little greasy.  Soggy fries.  And, unfortunately, the ketchup was not Heinz as presented.  The bottle was definitely old and refilled with an off brand.   On the bright side, our server was very friendly and efficient. We won't be back.	1.0
This is a large place with a bit of an odd lay-out. They seem to offer something for everyone, a pleasant looking outdoor patio w/ live music, a pub-like restaurant, a cellar bar, and a catering room (or two). I can only speak to my recent experience in their catering room. The room is medium sized and seemed to be able to accomodate approx 100. We were 6 tables of 8 and we were lost in the room. Additionaly someone set up the speaker's lecturn far from the tables so it was even less personal. The problem wasnt the room. It was the service. The service was rushed and unprofessional. Servers were clearing plates before people had finished eating and they did not appear to listen to the pace of the retirement party. The coffee service was serve your own and the desserts were plopped on the table as an after thought. They changed bartenders at least once for a retirement party on a cash bar that didnt seem to be too challenging. An elderly man asked for a lime for his bottle of Corona, but after searching for several minutes in the back, the server returned and apologized for not having a single lime in the entire restaurant. I hope the rest of the place offers better service. Even if the food was good, and it was just ehhh, I've worked in the catering industry and the folks working this room didnt do a good job.	2.0
The food is ok. If you eat in the dining room the atmosphere is quiet and boring. They are overpriced and their service is terrible.	2.0
So I came since I had a Groupon and read the rave reviews.   This is a local spot that's suppose to have been around for quite some time and locals swear by it.  We came on a Sat night around 8pm for dinner.  The place was I would say 80% full.  We stood by the hostess desk waiting for someone to come and greet us.  We did see some waitresses pass by, the bartender was at the bar directly in front of us but I guess we forgot to disable our invisible cloak so that they could see us as we stood for almost 15 mins without anyone acknowledging us.   Somehow an older gentleman (Mr. Errie) must've had x-ray vision as he went behind the hostess desk and looked at me.  I said, "must be really busy tonight" in which he replied "it's always busy" and walked away...wtf ?!?!  So I looked at my DW and kids who were starving and I was about to head out the door Groupon or none and the hostess finally comes around.  I blurted out " table for 4 please!" in case my invisible cloak was still on and she can't see me but luckily she did (or unlucky?).  We sat down and our waitress greets us and ordered our drinks.  We ordered the Sauerbraten, Wienerschnitzel, Duck breast, and a cheeseburger for my little one.   Now I must say that the dishes all looked good but that's all it did- looked good.  The taste well, it was just a meh for me and my family.  The Sauerbraten whom some say was the best is just an overcooked pot roast sliced and served with gravy and a bunch of spatzle (cut dough noodles).  Reminded me of some meat loaf I had back in the 80's highschool cafeteria but this costed almost $20.   Now I know my schnitzels but I don't know the difference between a Schnitzel vs the Wienerschnitzel but I much prefer the Schnitzel as this Wienerschnitzel was dry and overcooked.  It also came with lots of spatzle and some red cabbage.  The duck breast was bland and was cooked medium and sat on some blueberry jam ,  er.....I meant blueberry sauce accompanied by some steamed frozen veggies.   I think my son loved his cheeseburger which I did not had the chance to try.  Overall the bill came to almost $70, luckily for Groupon it was much less.  As we left I guess our invisible cloak accidentally turned on as nobody saw or said anything except I caught a gleam on the Mr. Erie's face as we left.  I guess maybe I came on a bad day or ordered the wrong food but these were all highly recommended by local Yelpers.  Would I come back?  Probably this Pheasant won't be Landing here anytime soon.	2.0
We went for Mother's Day Brunch and the experience in a word was awful. First, the lady at the door asked me for my name and number and proceeded to tell us our party had arrived. She showed us to a table where another family was sitting. I told her that I didn't know these people. She said I should wait outside until she resolved the issue. After 10 minutes I complained and she moved the family to another table. She then said we can sit down. I asked her to change the settings and water classes and she threw a fit. I said they were there for over 15 minutes and how do I know they didn't drink out of the glasses. That was the start. The food was subpar, basic waffles,French toast,eggs and 1 "carving station". Since we were almost last to get to the buffet, most of the trays were empty and we had to ask to get them refilled. The desert was  non existent . On top of all that they added a 20% gratuity for non existent service. Stay away for these types of events.	1.0
Didn't enjoy the food much. I really wanted to try some game meat, but in the form of sausages, they all tasted the same.	2.0
Here's a quick run down... The pub is not so hot..the food, nothing special to write home about. I saw a bunch of great reviews below and am sitting here scratching my head wondering what in the world I'm missing here! I didn't find anything about the place "exceptional" by any means. One thing that annoys me a little is that their menu isn't all that comprehensive either. I'd pass on dining here unless you're really curious.	2.0
If I could give this 0 stars I would. This place is absolutely terrible. I've been there twice and had horrible meals and bad service both times. The first time my boyfriend and I went there we ordered off of the regular menu and  the pasta he got looked and tasted like it was out of a can and my meal was just mediocre. I don't even remember what I ordered because it made no impression on me. We thought we ordered off the wrong menu so the second time we ate at Slate we tried the bar menu. Since we didn't order alcohol with our burgers the waitress only checked on us once the whole time we were there. She didn't even bother to refill our water and sodas. This wouldn't be that big of an issue but the table next to us who ordered drinks got great service and they looked like they were having a pretty good time. I couldn't even finish my burger because the meat was dry and the bun was soggy. On top of everything it isn't cheap either! Bad! Bad! Bad!  This place shouldn't be in business.	1.0
SLOW! Was here for dinner a few weeks ago. Got the mussels but I couldn't try them because they had sausage, which was not mentioned on the menu, so my boyfriend had to eat them all. Had the tempeh & tofu entree, which was good, but came out 40 minutes after he'd finished the mussels. He said the burger was good. The waitress was friendly but never refilled our waters... she was behind the bar texting. The reason I can't give any more stars despite OK quality food, was because none of the beers on the menu were on tap, and then there was this gunk at the bottom of the glass... He was not pleased to finish the beer and see that he'd been drinking from a dirty glass.	1.0
Mediocre bar with bad service and they even charge a dollar for ice in drinks, which isn't much, but just made me feel scammed.  I won't be going back	1.0
15 minutes for drinks to arrive 40 minutes for salads/appetizers to arrive 80 minutes for entrees to arrive The smoked salmon appetizer was supposed to be served on a potato pancake, but came out served on top of a pile of....mashed potatoes??? As someone said below, 'Uhm...this place is so weird".  The pasta came out raw - not al dente - uncooked. Yes, raw pasta.  They offered to fix it, but since we had already been sitting for 90 minutes and had to get to a party across town, we declined.  The check arrived with no adjustments, but after a short conversation that went something like "Seriously?", they took the pasta dishes off of the check.  To be fair, the waiter tried hard and the pulled pork was good - but I'm not sure how this place can still be in business.  I guess open table availability will get people in the door - once.	1.0
Service awful, food mediocre. There are much better venues in Philly - don't waste your time	1.0
This is easily the worst restaurant in philadelphia.  There was one waiter for the entire restaurant.  He was distracted and had no idea what was going on.  We waited 1.5 hours for our food, which was beyond mediocre.  Then he puts an 18% gratuity on a party of 5, saying that it is their policy.  It's my policy never to go back to awful restaurants, and it should be yours never to visit Slate. Slate should enjoy a speedy burial next to other comparable culinary disasters, such as Midtown IV.	1.0
Two stars as food was OK.  However, food took forever and beer is expensive.  I guess you're paying to be in Rittenhouse.  Advice is to go somewhere else for beer unless you want to be seen in an overpriced beer bar.  OK, food order was LOST and we were running late for a show and the mgr. or owner came out and basically said it's our fault (he said we need to tell them we need food in normal time).  HE REALIZED THE WAITRESS LOST THE ORDER AND still did nothing - his blaming us, we think was the place was empty and he had no business.  Maybe this place is closing soon.  There were 8 or us and NO ONE WAS HAPPY.  GO ELSEWHERE........	2.0
Awful service.  Mediocre food.  Their vegetable pasta did not have any of the vegetables they have listed on the menu. I ordered the hanger steak. Food didnt all come out at the same time for the table. My entire table received their entrees and mine never came. I asked multiple times about the status of my dish and finally got my food 45 minutes after my table got their food.  Worst experience I've had ever at a restaurant hands down. Manager and server never even apologized. I was very disappointed and will not be returning to this place.	1.0
This has a great atmosphere and ambiance, but that's about the only thing which is good here. We came with a group of 10 and had made a reservation 2 weeks prior. When we arrived they were understaffed-thus our food came out late and cold. 1 member of our group did not even get his food until everyone else was finished. If that wasn't bad enough, the menu items did not come out as listed on the menu. Example:the vegetable pasta was listed as including wild mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini and carrots. It came out with just zucchini and carrots which conveniently happened to be the same thing and the "vegetable medley" served with other dishes which consisted of zucchini and carrots. When we inquired if mushrooms were available, the waitstaff was rude and completely dismissed the concern. Upon asking for the check-the waitstaff had an attitude and we're going to charge for the pasta which we did not even eat. Overall recommendation-do not eat here!	1.0
I really don't even know where to start. This is my first review and I am only writing it because our night here was such an epic failure. We made reservations for nine on new years. One of our party had their entre come forty minutes after the rest of the table. We never saw our waitress after she took our order. I got so fed up at one point I tried to go to the bar. I never got that drink order either. Food was mediocre.	2.0
We went in there on a Friday night and it was dead, that should of been our first clue. The restaurant is pretty inside and almost has this "fine dining" ambiance about it. They had two tvs inside that was on CNN instead of sports or something not as depressing. The bartender came over to take our drink order and I ordered a lemon drop martini. It was really bitter and tasted dirty, I couldn't drink it. The bartender and waitress were both nice though. We placed an order for appetizer mac and cheese and egg roll. We ordered a filet for the entree. While we were waiting for our food they brought out scallops to another table that smelled like rancid rotten fish and instantly made me nauseous. It was the most putrid thing I've ever smelled. Shortly after they brought out our apps. I took one bite of the mac and cheese and almost had to spit it out. The cheese tasted and smelled like sweaty gym socks. I was so disgusted that I cancelled the rest of our order and asked for the check. The waitress asked if we wanted a box for the food and I told her no. They still didn't get that it was because the food was awful. She was really nice so I didn't want to be rude and just paid for what I didn't eat and couldn't get out of there fast enough. I have never had an experience like that before in my life. I got really sick after I left the restaurant from eating 2 bites. I wouldn't wish this restaurant on my worst enemy. Not sure how they passed their health inspection or how it's even possible to charge what they do for that so called food.	1.0
I can only echo the others. This place is boring and serves mediocre food. It is also expensive. Three major negatives.	1.0
Stay away from the Sunday brunch. I do hope the rest of the week the food is better. This was the worst brunch I've ever experienced. The eggs were greasy. I sent it back and got the french toast which was just soggy bread drenched in sugar water with a mile of whip cream on top. We were the ONLY people there which I guess should have been a huge warning. Lesson learned.	1.0
Three of us had brunch there this Father's Day. We should have been worried when there was only two other tables with customers when we arrived at 12:30. The food was basic. They were "out" of iced tea- but my friend finally said can't you just make some hot tea and pour it over ice. My husband ordered scrambled eggs and bacon. He got a fried egg and had to ask for his bacon twice. Bloody Mary was overly spicy and the waitress/bartender who was new should not have been left alone.  Don't waste your money--there are too many other great places to eat in the city.	1.0
Empty on a Saturday night when all other nearby restaurants were busy. Service was mediocre. Waitresses also bartended. No one seemed to know the menu well. Dropped the bill off after clearing main course plates - without saying a word, asking how it was, asking if we wanted anything else. Food was adequate, but nothing special. Scallops, meh. Lamb Burger (special) was greasy, bun was wet and pasty. Tilapia special - watery. Tempeh and tofu - ugh (and that one is from a vegan) - the curry sauce was flavorless. Potatoes too garlicky. Generally, food bland, watery - lacked flavor and depth. No wonder why it was not crowded. No one seemed to care much about a good restaurant experience - not the kitchen or the service staff. The mixed reviews here are generous.	1.0
Really expensive finger food for the price of a solid lunch. Nothing to brag about and the place just felt dirty inside. The whole menu set up was also very confusing and odd. The scallops were cold and the muscles were very very small but the sauce was good. Service was great though!	2.0
If you're looking to waste 10 minutes before a menu gets thrown your way and an additional 35 minutes before your food arrives, then this is the place for you! To be honest, it's quite impressive that a place that only hires one person to wait on 20 is still in business.  It could be due to the food, which was good.  However, when weighed against the lack of service and the time wasted, I think its obvious that there needs to be some management 101 here.  Oh and more employees who have the time to care about the costumers.  I was almost convinced that the lady working the bar and waiting the tables was also the person cooking our food.   Cheers.	2.0
After spending an entire week of bouncing ideas around for somewhere to go for a group dinner in Philadelphia and not coming to one compromise, we finally agreed to eat at Slate, last-minute, at 8 PM on the Friday night we were due to go out. We probably should have turned around when we stopped in at dinner time on a Friday and we were the only people there.  That's not true... there were a couple of people at the bar, but the tables were completely empty... at 8 PM... on a Friday... in the middle of the city!   However, we'd read somewhat good reviews here on Yelp, so we banked on a hopefully positive experience. This didn't happen.  Our waitress was friendly and there was no noticed, extensive wait for our plates, but the food and prices for each killed the mood for the rest of the night. We had the cheese plate as an appetizer, which was admittedly very good.  Our party of four also split the scallops, which were good, but one of them was ICE COLD.  This began the trip downhill. As for our four entrees: 1. Cornish Game Hen - this was described as dry and dissatisfying. 2. Glazed Duck Breast  - the duck itself was described as good, but the sauce was overpowering and the vegetables were cold. 3. Vegetarian Pasta - my friend ate just a few bites. He'd been expecting a white sauce based on the "shallot cream sauce" description.  He's a Restaurant School graduate.  The sauce was red. 4. I had the Filet, which hands-down reminded me of the Salisbury Steak tv dinners, mixed with a hint of my mom's meatloaf.  The texture of the "steak" and the brown gravy atop it had me looking for the microwave brownie portion of the plastic TV dinner tray.   Needless to say, we were ALL disappointed with our entrees, even though we wanted to like the place so badly.  We each had two drinks, nothing extravagant.  My friends had two beers each while I had two glasses of Chardonnay.   We are never ones to get down about paying for exceptional service and food, but when the bill arrived and was over $200, we were stunned.  That would have made my TV dinner, my portion of the cold scallop (we were served 3 scallops/four people), and my two glasses of wine a +$50 plate.  We all described the moment as being "duped".  We felt like we paid for all of the empty tables that night. Needless to say, we will not be returning to Slate.  There are entirely too many other amazing food options in Philadelphia for the same amount of money that are worth every single penny.   Hopefully, next time, we agree on one in time.	2.0
Good food.  But over-priced and over-hyped.	2.0
We went with another couple who suggested it and although the drinks were good, the service prompt, and the food was good, it was severely overpriced. I realize it's Rittenhouse but the food portion to the hanger steak was absolutely absurd. I ordered a hanger steak fully expecting a decent size steak but instead received a quarter of the size of a normal steak. It was almost insulting. My friend who had been here before and had ordered the steak previously, was shocked and disappointed how small they had made the portion. I don't mind more "European portions" but this was ridiculous. My friend had to end up eating half of his girlfriend's meal because he was still so hungry and he's not a huge portion eater by any means either. It was a Saturday night and the place was absolutely dead, which seemed a bit odd especially on a lovely summer night. Seems this place is hurting financially and has decided to try and cut back on the food costs to the customer's detriment. I have literally had more steak on a steak salad. Good food but just not worth the price.	2.0
I went to Slate for brunch, and it was pretty empty, which should have been a bad sign. Overall, this place is very generic and had a somewhat uncomfortable dining room; the food was bland, and my eggs were overcooked. I was very surprised by the lack of coffee options: they didn't carry iced coffee, espresso drinks, or milk other than half and half. That's fine for dinner, but I'd say coffee and breakfast foods go together.  Judging from the few other people in the place, it seems like the main appeal of Slate is its drink specials, so if you want to get loaded on a Sunday morning, this might be a good spot.  If you don't want to be around a group of loaded people, this might be a bad spot. The wait staff was very nice and prompt, but overall I'd say this restaurant is fairly sad during the daylight hours. I'm not sure that I would go there to see what it's like at night.	2.0
I arrived to a nearly empty restaurant on Sunday night with no one to greet me; actually, no one there at all! No host, no bartender, no server to be seen. I would have walked out right then but I had already made a reservation through Savored. After a few minutes of awkwardly standing in the entrance, the hostess/waitress/bartender emerged from the kitchen to seat us. We started with the spinach & poached egg and beet salads, both of which were good. And then we waited for our entrees, the tilapia special with shrimp, crab and scallops. And waited... After 30 minutes we asked the waitress when we could expect the meals. She proceeded to list off all the occupied tables in the restaurant (3) and inform us that there was only one chef in the kitchen, like it was my problem. So we waited 10 minutes before I asked again, and she assured us they would be right out. But we  still waited and just as we were about to cancel the entrees, they magically appeared. The waitress apologized and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Maybe it was because I was starving, but the entree was actually decent tasting. Just as we were finishing the meal, the waitress brought us out bread pudding, also on the house. It's a shame that the service was so poor because the food was actually pretty good. I appreciated that she tried to make up for the long wait, but the whole experience was so unenjoyable that it just wasn't enough for me.	2.0
Rating 2.75 Came here on a Sat around 1 pm - just missed the brunch crowds. There were only 3 other tables where people were eating otherwise the restaurant was empty. However, they only had one waitress who took FOREVER to take our order and the chef took even longer to make it. Otherwise the food was good - ordered a burger, which was excellent but by the time I got it I was so hungry that it probably made it taste better. Not sure. I think it if hadn't been for the wait, I would have rated a 3-star.	2.0
This is the WORST!  OVER PRICED!  3 Little scallops (COLD!!! and cut in half!!!---they were about 1/4 inch thick!) for $10!  The other apps I got were rediculously over priced!!!  The Bartender was Very Nice!  I got take out.  I got home and almost cried! After eating $30 worth of food, I was STILL HUNGRY!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!	1.0
First and last visit for brunch. We ordered two of the simplest dishes, scrambled eggs with home fries, salad and bacon and eggs. Forty five minutes later still no food, we left. I will say their coffee is good,	1.0
Um... This place is super weird. I went with three girlfriends at 7:30 on a Wednesday for drinks. There was literally not another soul besides us in the place. That's not a good sign. Admittedly, I didn't eat anything. But they were empty and yet our service from the bartender (and we were sitting AT the bar) was terrible. Their draught beer list was not up to date and the bartender had no idea what they actually had on tap. We kept trying to order different beers from their list, and we were told they didn't have each one anymore, in succession.  It's like... Ok well then what DO you have, and why don't you update your menu?  Finally, my friend was served wine from a bottle that must have been sitting for weeks because it tasted like vinegar. No thanks.	1.0
I'll likely never forget my meal at Slate, not because of the joyful tears that come to my eyes when I think of the food at this cozy neighborhood restaurant and bar but because of the utter blandness of food.  I came here with two other dining companions after we purchased a LivingSocial deal and realized it was about to expire; being the poor college students we were we were obligated to use it despite the misgivings we had from the lackluster Yelp reviews and the advice we received from friends and family. Still, nevertheless we secured a reservation on a Saturday night and slopped down to Slate.  As we arrived, we discovered more signs of a potentially disastrous night to come.  The restaurant was completely empty.  It never a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and find it deserted, much less at 8 pm on a Saturday night and find that the only other patron at the restaurant is a middle aged gentleman sitting at the bar.   Alas, we were still cheap college students and weren't going to let $40 of a LivingSocial deal go to waste.  Once we entered the restaurant, we were quickly seated (which is not all the extraordinary when you are more or less the only eaters in the restaurant, which sadly was one of the highlights of the evening) and ordered a round of drinks.  The cocktails were strong and delicious - a promising start to the night.  Yet the promises and goodwill developed by the drinks quickly faded once we ordered our entrees.  The drinks got our hopes up - perhaps this was just a neighborhood gem that had just been kept a secret for too long.  Sadly, we were wrong. We opted for the entree option of our LivingSocial deal and ordered the green curry tofu, the salmon, and the fillet.  There's not much to describe except revel in the fact that the restaurant had somehow taken beautiful ingredients and made them completely bland.  People often talk about empty calories how drinking beer or soda makes you fat because you're consuming deliciously sugary calories while not satisfying your hunger - making you fuller and fuller.  Slate accomplished the exact opposite of the empty calorie phenomenon.  My dining companions and I definitely felt full after we finished our meal, yet we we consumed it without consuming any semblance of flavor. The service?  Very good.  Although as I've probably over referenced in the review, not that surprising when you consider us to be the only patrons in the restaurant. One stars.	1.0
I went to Slate for a late-ish lunch on a Tuesday, and it was not a positive experience.  On one hand, I think the food is here is really tasty.  I had the local beef burger, which has onions and boursin cheese on it -- it is amaaaaaazing.  Honestly, one of the juiciest burgers I've ever eaten.  The bun is buttery and a perfect complement to the burger.  The fries are good too although maybe a little overcooked. The problem is that the service kind of sucks.  My group of 3 had to wait 45 minutes to get our food served, which is just unacceptable on a Tuesday when only a few other customers are in the restaurant.  The explanation from the waitress was that the kitchen is "really small."  I don't think that's an adequate excuse.  A restaurant that has 20 tables in it should be able to prepare food for more than one table at a time, am I right?   The waitress did bring us free dessert for having to wait for such a long time, so I give them points for trying.  By the way, the chocolate mousse cake and the almond cake are delicious.  Either way, I won't go back here unless I have a lot of time to kill and nowhere to go.	2.0
The food was good but not great, the service (on a Saturday night) was terrible. Based on other reviews, I'd have been better off trying brunch than dinner here. Based on my own experience, not planning to go back.	2.0
Empty on Sunday nite but still mediocre service. Food was also only so-so. Crab cakes had unpleasant stringy texture and no taste. Def. Not the backfin meat the waiter claimed. Would not do this again.	2.0
Can't remember the last time I ate at such a bad restaurant. There were two other tables taken during brunch (telling), and it took over 30 minutes to get our food. I ordered egg whites and what came out neither looked or tasted like egg. I hate complaining in restaurants, but when the waitress came over my friend declared that I did not like my meal. She asked how she could fix it (the only positive part of the experience). The waffle replacement I got was mediocre at best.	1.0
Great atmosphere.  Mac and cheese app was rather tasty.  but I came for the Slate Burger.  Sadly, it didn't measure up.  I have had it twice, the first time was over the summer and I recall enjoying it so maybe it was an off night.  It sounds delicious: a burger stuffed with mushrooms and short-rib meat.  How can you go wrong?  It was too fatty and half way through, the lower half of my bun had dissolved.  Not sure if I will go back but I doubt it.  Sorry there just isn't much more to say about it.	2.0
I'd love to give Slate 1.5 stars, but I think it's closer to 2 than 1 so I'll err on the side of generosity. Had brunch at Slate today 'cause the wait at Day by Day was too insane. This might be the raison d'etre of Slate's brunch. It's not really good enough to stand on its own, but it does a decent job in cleaning up Day by Day's leftovers. The food was good. Not great. Satisfactory; not worth traveling for (there's totally somewhere just as good in your neighborhood; I live in the culinary dead zone of the inner Main Line and Slate doesn't improve upon the local "meh" restaurants out here). Among tus we had a frittata (meh & an awfully dainty serving), eggs benedict (good, although the muffins weren't toasted so everything cooled down quickly - that's even after we sent back the first benedict that came out stone cold), the short rib mac & cheese (didn't taste it but it got rave reviews from a friend). The salad on the side of each plate was nice and well dressed. The toast was embarrassing - white or wheat only, and it seriously might have been Wonder Bread. Cheap, throwaway bread from Giant. Jam was the plain Smucker's packets you get at diners. Charging $2 for a side of Wonder Bread is pretty criminal. Service is where we ran into trouble. Three of our four meals came out at one time; the eggs benedict came out five minutes later. The waitress had forgotten our toast orders (after an extensive conversation about options - do you have rye? She wasn't sure; turned out no. What kind of jam do you have? She didn't think they had jam at all. etc.) entirely - and then took over 10 minutes to bring it out (how long does it take to make toast?). Forgot a friend's side order of home fries; those didn't come out until he'd finished his mac & cheese. It took us five minutes to flag down a busboy to send back the benedict; our waitress was nowhere to be found. All in all, Slate's brunch just didn't add up into being worth the bother. There are way too many terrific brunches to be had to spend any time or money on this one.	2.0
2.5 ish... Came to Slate for brunch because Day by Day had a long line and we were a bit crunched for time.  Slate was relatively empty for a Sunday lunch time.   Got off to a not-so-great start when the waiter wiped down a table near the window for us with a smelly wet rag (you all know that smell...ugh).  He wiped down the chairs too and they were still wet when we were motioned to sit down.  I hovered awkwardly above my chair wafting it with my hands to make it dry more quickly.  The smell remained. I was further displeased when my coffee came barely 2/3 full in the mug.  Thankfully it was refilled promptly.   The brunch menu is pretty no-frills.  Lots of eggs and lots of cheese.  I went with one of the specials: Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon.  I must admit, it was pretty damn tasty.  Hollandaise is such a glorious thing.  The home fries were pretty bland - would have done well with a sprinkle of sea salt and black pepper. Overheard the table beside me ask for no-egg options and the waitress offered the Quiche and had to be corrected by the diners...clearly not the most experienced waitstaff it seems. They left without ordering.   Finally I was a a little annoyed that the waiter came over to check if we were done when it clearly looked like one of my friends was still working on hers.  Meh, just a silly pet peeve.  I enjoyed the food for the most part, and I might give this place a second chance.  I think I was just a little turned off by the service.	2.0
saturday dinner, 7pm, 3 friends it felt like slate was in an identity crisis.  The tables are tacky and the decor (or the lack of) is very "cold"  the thing that bugged me the most was the location of the bathrooms, im sorry but i truly believe the bathroom doors shouldnt swing out so close to the dining room.  at least separate the areas with something.   food - there was one vegetarian entree, not cool local beef burger - overcooked and i would not consider the fries "cliantro fries" cajun popcorn po' boy - nice try stuffed burger - again, overcooked and nice try on the truffle fries service - off. would i go back - NO	2.0
I was excited to see a new burger joint in the neighborhood.  But turns out it wont be my new favorite.  Actually I don't plan on going back.  I was just really put off by an inattentive waitress, we went for the $5 basket of fries to share (because nothing comes with any sides) and when they came were limp and cold but the waitress never came by for us to say anything to about it.  It almost seemed like there was one waitress and a water boy and like 4 other people standing around near the kitchen doing nothing. The fries came with two little cups of special sauces- a curry ketchup and something else called special sauce, which I liked, and asked the water guy for more of, and was charged $.55 for a extra tablespoon of sauce.  WOW.  I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  They spent a ton of money on the interior decor.  It's over done.  They tried so hard to make it hip that its just nauseating instead.  Sorry I guess I just wanted a good burger.	2.0
I am a Jefferson Employee and like to get out of the office and have lunch at least 3 times a week. I was on my way to Fuel and came across this burger place and figured that I would give it a try. The atmosphere is very trendy really clean and nice lighting fixtures. The staff seamed nice although I did think it was strange that there was no woman working there ?.... I ordered the Guadalupe burger it was very tasty. When I went to the counter to order the person asked me if I want to order fries. I then realized that the burger was 9.50 with a 10% discount WOW ! that's high. The clerk was interrupted  by another guy  that I later figured out was one of the owners super pale kid with large eyes. He explained that when I saw what I was getting that it would not seem expense. I told him that I will just have the burger with that he continued to push French fries and told me that if I want "Wendy's" food I could go for Wendy's prices. Since I order a turkey burger and do not eat red meat he should have paid more attention to the detail of my order never the less I told him it really does not matter please just give me the burger and I will be on my way. He continue that it does  matter and that he's sick of reading on YELP that the prices are too high and that people need to understand  what they are getting. With that I politely told him that I am on my lunch break and frankly he was beyond annoying me. Let's just say I will not be back. When someone says they do not want fries and then you have to explain why you do not want fries and listen to their BS and validation about Yelp comments. Also maybe as an owner you could work side by side instead of sitting at the counter asking customers random questions and then mistaking them for other people that you handed fries out to earlier in the day - so NOT  personal. It was like a bad used car salesman. I give this place 6/8 mths tops !	2.0
Don't bother with this restaurant.  They no longer serve the food that made them good enough to franchise.  They pass it off as not being able to please everyone with menu updates.  The problem is people who eat there on a regular basis have no desire to return as a result of said changes.	1.0
Stupidly expensive. Everything is a la carte, and honestly, just average burgers. The staff have no idea what's on the menu...	1.0
I was very excited when somoene told me about a Bareburger opening where the 5 Guys used to be for 2 reasons: I love burgers and I love bears.  I was very disappointed to find out there were almost no bears involved of any kind and certainly not a single panda.  If you made the same mistake I did, I feel your pain.  It is actually "bare," and that is aptly named as the burger I had there was lacking of any redeeming qualities. Food: The burgers/sandwiches we had were just horrible, and even more so for the price.  If you make such a huge deal about using bison and goats and penguins for your burger, your burger better be the shiznit. You ever had "cherry" flavored robitussin?  That nonsense doesn't taste like cherries at all, son!  Similarly, my bison burger looked like a burger, but that's about it.  Go to your pantry, roll up a paper towel, and put it inside a brioche bun with a "green leaf," wtf-ever that means (it seriously says "green leaf" on that burger on the menu).  Close your eyes and take a big bite.  You will have replicated the taste and texture of the El Matador burger, and I just saved you $12.65 (minus the cost of your paper towel and green leaf).  If your paper towel accidentally gets moist, however, then this comparison no longer applies as your paper towel must truly be bone dry to get a sense of what this burger was like.  We also had the "Duck Duck Gouda," which was essentially a less pleasing form of a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich.   To be fair, the fries and onion rings were pretty good.  If you eat a full meal of fries and onion rings I could see you being happy here.  Remember that these potatoes and onions were all free range potatoes and onions, mind you, and each one of them had names like "Atticus" or "Lincoln." Service:  We had a friendly but busy waiter who was pretty enthusiastic about the food and the brand in general.  Service was a bit slow, which makes sense as everyone there spends 5 minutes informing you their food is 100% organic, free range, antibiotic free, gluten free, hormone free, coddled livestock.  After hearing the pitch, it would lead you to believe that someone is reading fairy tales to these goats at night and braiding their hair while they fingerpaint and write haikus. In summary: People who would like Bareburger: - you care very strongly about eating a meal that is free of any hormones, antibiotics, or gluten - you don't care very strongly about eating a juicy burger with any taste - you don't care that a burger and fries costs you about $20 People who would not like Bareburger: - you like your burgers to be good - you don't like getting ripped off - you went in wanting to pet a bear	2.0
What a waste! Was excited about going here  as they showed up in a list of gluten free restaurants however NONE of their meat patties are marked gluten free!!! Not even the grilled chicken! What's the point of carrying GF buns and marking gluten free on the menu when there is clearly no intention of truly catering to gluten free diners? The only GF burger is also vegan. What's the point of going to a burger joint and not being able to get a burger??? This whole gluten free "effort" is FRAUDULENT!	1.0
Over cooked meat is a crime for a burger joint. Not that they asked how we wanted it cooked. Nothing blew my mind especially for how long it took. Wiki wiki burger had a unique flavor and I liked the pineapple addition. Grindhouse was just okay. Didn't seem special. Meats were different but not particularly flavorful. Onion rings were really good! Sweet potato fries were decent. We went and ordered take out. 15-20 minutes turned into a lil over a half hour for two burgers. Shorted staffed on a Saturday? Friendly staff. I  will be back for beers after they get their liquor license. Maybe will give the food another try.	2.0
Overall a 1 star experience.  I'd say almost a solid 4 on the menu/food, but absolutely negative service.   Came in for lunch hour, just after 12:00pm.  The host immediately advised us "it's cash only right now" before, almost begrudgingly, showing us to a table.  A bottle of water arrived with menus.  Our Server arrived fairly promptly to take our order (party of 2).  That was the last time we saw him.  Never returned to see if we needed more water/soda as we sat there quietly for 40 minutes wondering if we were going to be getting food, or even to check in and let us know of the lengthy wait.  Many other tables seemed to be experiencing the same thing as they sat looking at their watches and phones.  over the course of 45 minutes, eight burgers came out for a table of six and another table of two.  9 other tables had no food and were either seated before we came or shortly after us.   As we were deciding whether to just get up and leave, at 12:59pm, now 45-50 minutes after placing the order with the initial server, another person (runner or kitchen staff) brought our orders, which we then needed to box to go to get back to work from lunch hour.  Even with us asking for boxes, no one cared.  Any other server would have picked up on the fact this is completely wrong! Waited another 10 minutes to get the check which we requested when the other guy brought our to go boxes. Nothing for several minutes and then asked the hostess for the check.  Again, she seemed annoyed, walked to the back for three to four minutes, and then back to the front without stopping to say a word to us whether it might be coming or not.  5 minutes later a check came, and still not from our original server who we finally now located again, hanging out at the back counter.   Other tables around, fairly full on a Friday afternoon were seen sitting and waiting just as long, no servers coming out to see if they needed anything or let them know of the delay in getting their orders.   Zero customer service.  Not one of the six to eight people working there were interacting with customers. No apologies or explanation why food wasn't coming, no checking in to see if drinks needed refreshed.   Did finally get to try the burger after getting back to work, 20 minutes late from lunch hour.  Ordered the Supreme, and it was great and still managed be a little warm.  Can't say anything bad about the food, just wish the service was as good, or even mediocre and I could've dealt with that, but here it's just non-existent.   We get a lot of out town clients and I'd love to be able recommend this to them, always looking for new and good places for lunch/dinner, however there's more that goes into a restaurant than good food.   I'm about 95% that I won't go back but hopeful they can get it together and maybe give it another shot, otherwise I'll look for the closed sign to show up soon and see what goes in there next.	1.0
Horrible experience. Friends come over on Friday night 9/19/14 and decide they are hungry. Knowing bareburger is new in the area I take this as a perfect opportunity to try it. I walk in at 10:40pm and no host at the stand. He is wiping tables and says to me "sorry sir, but takeout only now." I was okay with that. I was going to make a six person order and take it back to my apt.... Only, when I get to the counter, 3 people leaning behind the counter look at me confused. When I say I'd like to make a takeout order, the guy says the kitchen is closed. I look at my watch and at the three booths that still have people eating.... And back at him. He musters out a "sorry." I then turned to leave and when I got half way to the door he said "sir, would you like to take a menu so that you can see what we have and come back later?" Really dude? No! What I'd like is to order actual food for the 5 hungry people at my apt from the restaurant I specifically came to try at 10:40 on a weekend night in center city.   I'd like to comment on the food, but I wasn't able to try it. Then I was met with bad customer service on top of it. Needless to say I won't be coming back to try the food. I took myself and my money out of the front door of bareburger and went to one of the many other places on walnut that weren't seemingly perturbed to see a customer walk into their establishment. Bad business guys...just bad business.	1.0
While waiting for the "Book of Mormon" lottery the past few days we have been watching them put the finishing touches on this new burger joint. R told me it was open and I was craving a burger so off we went. We ordered fries and rings. The onion rings were delicious, but the fries were mushy and not crisp or crunchy. The sauces and the ketchup weren't our cup of tea. The smoke sauce is best, but smuggle in your own Heinz. I also think it's sort of weird that they don't have a soda fountain or gun. It's all bottled soda. With fries/burgers I always want something carbonated and generally a troth of it. I am American after all! So, the burgers come. The buns are bigger than the burger. The buns have these weird seeds on them. Flax? Uncertain. My beef burger doesn't even taste like ground beef. The texture is bizarre. I ate half. I just didn't feel like complaining or I would have. The pickles however are delicious! I had a side of sweet pickles and dill pickles on my burger. The stout onions were good as well. R had the bean burger and said it had no taste or seasonings. The guac on it she said tasted heavily of raw onion. She was not impressed. She also ordered a vanilla milkshake, but said it was lackluster. Our bill was 44! Ridiculous we didn't even have cocktails or a dessert. Definitely not returning and hope you will get your burger on elsewhere!	2.0
Hmmmm--I must have eaten in a different place than the other reviewers.  Hostess was not at her place when we arrived--and when we walked in, she was less than enthusiastic in her greeting.  The space is nice--4 of us were seated in a nice booth.  Our waiter was very energetic and informative--although maybe a little too enthusiastic in his recommendations.  He mixed up the orders at our table.  While I appreciate the concept, the burgers were ordinary.  And expensive.  The onion rings were good, but not great.  It took about 20-25 minutes to get our food,  and just as long to get dessert--vegan carrot cake and chocolate shake.  Our waiter made several excuses for the kitchen--for instance, it was the chef's first time making the carrot cake.  Seriously? Overall, this place has a long way to go in my opinion, and I don't think that I would return.   The staff are dressed casually--bordering on sloppy.  Our bill totaled over $75 plus tip--way too much for mediocre burgers and a couple of desserts.	2.0
The food was a step above duck food and the owners (i assume they were the owners) were big a$$holes. I couldn't stand to work there the way they talked about the workers and patrons. Food should be enjoyable. This place wasn't.	2.0

I like the idea but it didn't do it for me. I have celiac so I had to pick a gluten free item. I went with the lemon chicken (Lemon Chicken Grilled chicken breast, roasted fennel and mushrooms, spinach, broccoli rabe, green olives and brown basmati rice in a light lemon sauce, finished with toasted almonds and parsley) The chicken portion was very small and the rest of it just didn't do it for me. I threw most of it away. Granted, I'm not a huge vegetable person but I just didn't like it at all.	2.0
This place is great in concept, but poor in execution. It's concept is that it's convenient healthy food. But it's really just clever marketing of pre-made food. I went for line one day and thought the food was OK, worth a 3 star rating. Chicken felt slightly rubberized and portions were small (any place can keep the calorie count down if the portions are small). Then I decided to go for breakfast on my way to work one day... I go up and look at the menu, and see everything has mushrooms on it. Ok no prob, I'll just get it without mushrooms. I place my order and ask for no mushrooms, and the cashier pulls out what looks like a nfl coach's play card and says "I'm sorry but the only thing we can take off that item is...the sauce" I change my order to something else, and she goes back to that card, they can't take anything off but the sauce. The third selection? You guessed it, everything stays on but the sauce. So this place fails in two ways: you can't customize an order, big no no. Second failure is that it's clearly all pre-made. You expect me to believe a place is really that healthy if all the food is pre made and frozen/preserved? No thanks, I'll just go to juice generation for a breakfast smoothie instead.	2.0
Worst service ever.  Lame, overpriced tacos.  I couldn't believe how we were treated, as if we didn't exist, and then, finally, when we did get service, it was very slow. The tacos were bland, and the sauces were blander.   Very expensive too.  I'll continue getting tacos @ Hop Devil Grill a couple doors down.  They have much better service, amazing pork shoulder tacos and salsa.   Lots of great craft beers and tequila too.	1.0
went there twice in one week. first time the girl at the counter was kinda blah. maybe it was because it was dead in the middle of the day and frigid outside (and inside too, turn on the heat). second time was dinner time and it was a gentleman working the counter. BOTH times w the girl and guy serving me the kept their gloves on to handle my money. after they finished the transaction, went right to handling the tortilla and making the food with the same gloves (who knows how long they have had them on). they are fn .01 a pair. they are made to be changed in between food making and non-food making activities guys. food: veggie taco: 5 rating..out of 10 the veggies were tasty and fresh from what i could tell. cold FLOUR tortilla was, eh ....cold? flour-y? tons of lettuce to fill space....i ate it all and it was ok beef taco: 1.5 of 10 again w the FLOUR tortilla that was again cold. at least if you are going to use flour....heat it up a bit. very greasy beef. low quality shredded cheese, tons of lettuce. tortilla was soaked through by the time i started eating it, which was less than 4 mins from the time i received it. made me feel ski-ill after eating it chicken quesadilla: 3.5 of 10 shredded dark? meat chicken. with shredded cheese. on a low quality flour tortilla (full size) then put in a george forman to "grill" it. don't give you any salsa, but you get a shot glass sized side of sour cream. i had to pan fry it to get some crisp at home. was very greasy and just not great. i get it you don't have grills or any heating elements w gas. but make a menu that works w induction, and microwaves. you can still get that grilled taste w/o a flat grill.	2.0
First time I went my quesadilla was on point and delicious and crunchy. Next time I went I got a really soggy quesadilla that I did not enjoy eating.... I mostly just dipped it in guacamole to cover up the grossness. Went back again recently hoping I'd get lucky and get a crunchy one again but no it was soggy again and I was really annoyed.	2.0
If you know about or like authentic Mexican food DONT go here. Better off at a taco truck. I personally hated it and didn't get what I paid extra for... Which is never a good sign. Just wasn't a good experience for me. And I felt $18 for 3 tacos and salsa was steep especially when he didn't even put all of what I paid extra for and I had to go back.	1.0
dear diary, this is the kind of taco I would make at home for myself i.e sloppy, tasteless, vaguely MEXICAN. Worst of all it tastes like all the ingredients were from Costco. vegetarian taco was useless. guac was ok- but the tortilla chips tasted very gourmet like and msg-enhanced: aka no buenõ. if it wasn't for the unlimited dosage of chipotle mayo and the 5 other corn syrup sweetened sauces, i probably would not be coming back, ever.	2.0
The burrito's rice was so hard it almost broke my teeth.  I went on a Saturday, so maybe just avoid buying burritos that day. I also felt worried about eating the chipotle mayo and other sauces as it was not refrigerated.  I felt the burrito really was overpriced.  Everything was far from what I know and love as taquitos y burritos en México.  The guys working there were nice enough, and I they may well be Mexican, but I doubt they designed the recipes as they did not really taste Mexican at all.	2.0
Decent value. Also nice to find beers on tap for under $4. But otherwise unremarkable in terms of flavor.  We had chicken, pork, and chorizo tacos and a chicken quesadilla.  The meats were all slow cooked/pulled, but lacked any zest. I didn't really like the flour tortillas they used---they didn't have the flakiness that good tortillas should have.  The jicama slaw was a nice touch though.	2.0
I've been to a few tacos places in NYC and I have to say this one isn't as good as the reviews claims. I've only been there once but their menu is limited to very few options. I decided to try out the Beef burrito and I actually wanted to give it back after the 1st bite. Now the burritos use flour tortillas and any real taco lover knows you use corn tortillas. They cooked their wraps on these electric grills which give no flavor to the food. Next came the beef. It was under cooked with little seasoning. When you order something make sure they can cook it properly. Finally no options of cilantro, onions or limes to add to my meal. I was disappointed.	2.0
Nastiest "mexican" food ever. Sugar in beans, sugar in veggie tacos. Generic, low quality tortillas and rubber cheese.	1.0

I hate to do this but I've been back here a few times recently and I'm disappointed at the flavor quality. Maybe it's me or maybe it's just been awhile so I forgot but the food isn't as flavorful as it used to be. The taco fillings are flavorless. I used to love the curry sauce but these days it doesn't have the kick it used to have, it's very bland and I find myself putting more and more on the bland tacos because the flavors don't have a blip on my tongue radar. Even the devil sauce is different. The very first time I tasted it, just a tiny amount was explosive, don't get me wrong, it's still spicy and I use it very sparingly but it's one of those just bearable spicy.	2.0
This is not Mexican food. The tortilla chips are out of a bag and my taco was on a  four tortilla. The food is flat out tasteless and I have never been impressed by the waitstaff/kitchen staff both times I was here.	1.0
They are good tacos; I'm giving it 2 stars though, because there are better places to eat the same type of food. The vegetarian option with butternut squash is very tasty; if I had to rate that one alone, it would be 4.5.  The chopped beef is alright, a 4. I'm more of a Mercadito or Pinche Taqueria type of eater, where the taste does not depend too much on the sauce alone, so the other meat tacos at Five Tacos were a little bland for me, with the accompanying filler (lettuce, etc), or filler texture (crispy/soft contrast) an afterthought.  They had a lot of sauces available at the table, but it's a bit of trial-and- error...some sauces clashed with some of the more flavor-infused tacos, and the sauces that worked with the blander tacos were pretty one dimensional.  The seating is communal.  One couldn't help overhearing loud and pretty annoying conversation going on from the 18-24 set because of the seating. I imagine it's the norm- the seating turned over twice while we were there and the conversation did not improve.  We made like Quakers and ate in silence, it was so awkward. It must have been awkward for them too, watching two old fogies doing mental eye rolling every time someone mentioned "Guac" instead of guacamole, or the word "awesome" in every other sentence.  All in all, a fun, young place to be if you're not there for the tacos alone (drink, too, dammit).  For old peeps over 28, a fun, young place to be if you are getting drunk and want a quick bite and a beer while you observe the young primitives.	2.0
Someone here gave this place positive reviews because "it's not in the back of a bodega." I want to kick that reviewer  in the eye. Ok, now for my review of this place. 1 star for service (I added a star for service because the owner invited me to come in and give them a second chance. That's good service.) 2 stars for food. 1.5 stars total. I walked in ready to spend some money to try out this new taco/burrito joint. I couldn't believe the cold, unfriendly reception I received. The woman at the counter knew I walked in, yet didn't even look up to say "hi" or "how can I help you?" or anything. I've lived in NYC for more than a decade and so my standards for service aren't tremendously high, but this was ridiculous. I had to interrupt her guac-making to ask her if I could order, to which she responded not with actual words or eye contact, but with a sigh of annoyance followed by a mumbled, "what do you want?" I don't know why I didn't listen to my senses that were screaming, "You're a jackass if you stay here. Take your hard earned money elsewhere!" I went jackass at that moment and ordered a terrible, terrible chicken burrito. As she finished the little tiny thing this place calls a burrito, I was struck to see her cut the burrito in half with a long diagonal. Pause and think about why this absolutely does not work for a good burrito. Chicken salad in a spinach-tortilla wrap - yes. Juicy meaty burrito with salsa, guac and melted cheese -- hell no! As soon as I picked up my first awkward triangle half, all the sad flavorless rice just poured right out along with the bland fillings. I had to eat it with a fork. There's Crif Dog next door and a authentic "bodega" tacos on 13th/A -- much more interesting food on which to spend your hard earned dollars.	2.0
Being form California, I always use to hear people complain about how bad the Mexican food was in NYC... Since I moved here I've actually eaten at plenty of good Mexican places. Last night we decided to try Five Tacos because we always walk past and it looks cute...... The food did not taste bad but it felt like I was eating at an upscale Taco Bell but my friends and l would probably still prefer Taco Bell. My friend who doesn't cook mentioned that she makes better Mexican food out of the packet seasoning from the grocery store. The only item that was awful and inedible was the Guacamole! It was very acidic and it tasted old.. like when you make it a day before and let it sit in the fridge. We all decided we could never return here even super drunk...  We did like the selection of beer.	2.0
EDIT: I never noticed this, but apparently the day I wrote my review, the owner of the business replied to me and told me that I'm fabricating this story, said he checked the cameras and I was never there, and that I probably work for a rival taco company. Thanks for the hearty laugh, friend! I was an unemployed college student at the time of the review and beyond that, have never ever worked in the food service industry whatsoever. So, in the interest of all disclosure, there's that. It's up to you, Yelp Reviewers, if you want to frequent a place whose management is so afraid of criticism that they fabricate stories... about customers fabricating stories. (I now live in CA, have for the past two years. Still don't work in the taco industry.) -------- The first time I came here, I would've given it four or five stars. I loved the burrito I had (ground beef) and felt that it was vastly superior to a lot of the taco places around the East Village. Today my boyfriend and I went back and unfortunately it was a disaster. First of all, the server was not skilled in how to make a burrito. I ordered the same thing as I had before, and was disappointed when it was an entire mess. Even wrapped up, it fell apart and I ended up just eating the filling with a fork. This sadly ended up being a mistake. The beef was not only flavorless-yet-overseasoned, it was cold. My boyfriend ordered the chicken (as he had the first time as well) and instead of it being somewhat spicy and flavorful as before, it was bland, unchicken-like and also cold. He also commented at one point that the meat didn't seem to have been separated well, as there were bits in it that were not edible. We tossed the remainders of our burritos and began walking to our destination, and both immediately felt sick. I'm aware that food poisoning doesn't usually strike for a few hours after eating bad food, but both of us separately started feeling terrible. I was keeping track of where the garbage cans were on the street because I was getting more and more sure that I was going to throw up. I'll spare you the details of my horrible indigestion, but suffice to say: it was not good. I can't see myself ever coming back here, which is a shame because my first experience was so lovely. Once a place is terrible and gets me sick, there's no reason to try it again.	1.0
At the owner's request I stop by last night around 9 PM to try his Tacos at his expense. I found that I could not be objective enough if I didn't pay myself, which I did by Amex. I strongly feel that when I review a place I do so with passion and sense of genuine open minded feelings. I am a professional of the Hospitality Business who takes his profession seriously. In order to be more objective, I asked a friend to join me to try a few things. During my visit I ordered 3 Beers, Guacamole and Chips, one naked Beef Taco and one naked Chorizo Taco. We sat in the middle of the Bar for approximately one hour. The GOOD... The beers very good. Good value. My bad that I said I had the IPA Capt Lawrence not the Pale Ale. My fault; please Crucifix me on the Cross. Jeeezzzzz. Anthony was outstanding as a server. I will be stealing him soon. Guacamole was good. Music good. The BAD... My friend and I split the naked Tacos. She tasted both and her comments were "Very similar in flavor but they did have flavor. Chorizo was a bit spicier". My friend did not read my reviews or any of the current reviews. I was told 14 months was spent in development of this product. The product looked and tasted like the "Sloppy Joe's" I use to get in Grammar School for lunch. I love Sloppy Joe's, but I want authentic Mexican tacos.  I have been told by ownership that "In my opinion  (time will tell) we have the best Tacos in NY, Period". This has been told to me 3 different times. They consider that over stuff Tacos (lettuce, tomatoes, corn, black beans, cheese) is a good Taco. Tacos have to have a balance of meat to veggies to tortilla. Like the commercial "were is the beef". I could say this about the beef and chorizo at Five Tacos. The veggies and cheese over power the Sloppy Joe type meat. Sorry dude, back to Taco school, Period.......... The UGLY... Something that has many legs and is 1/2 inch long on wood shelve above were supposedly taco mix is stored. I spent 20 minutes with my camera phone trying to catch this meat on the shelve. Ask the cook on duty on Thursday night if there was a guy with his cellphone taking pictures? This was the last straw. Three weeks old establishment and this issue exists. NO BUENO. I will correct my comment of 75 F degrees holding temp. I was told it was 75 C centigrade by the Owner. My bad. The 3 compartment sink is being use for BOTH washing veggies and HANDS. You know the violations. This I saw with my two eyes. I am not mentioning that red baskets after use are throw in employee hand washing sink before place in dish machine. Can post pictures. Overall, I will not be returning unless they are giving $100 for free. I don't like the Tacos it is something you could cook as good or better at home, Period......	1.0
Must preface this with the fact that I did not in the end even get to eat here - Just wanted to send a message - When you walk in, there is no clear access to tables, or employees - there is no take out menu to be seen, and standing in the lobby for 5 minutes with a confused look on my face  (twice within the space of one hour no less) does not produce any help from the employees (are there any?) I think front of the house stuff like this is essential for any new business - I really wanted to eat there today - I live a block away - But it was essentially impossible , and it wasn't even crowded in there.  here's hoping that they figure this stuff out...	1.0
Slightly better than Taco Bell.	2.0
Every office in the area knows about this place.  It's okay, but not the best.  If you get the specials, it'll be fresh. The better feature about this place is that they will deliver for breakfast and lunch at any time.  If you're in the office park, you can walk there.  They take fax orders and their menu does not change so as a safe bet if you'd like to order a tuna wrap or a grilled cheese, it'll be there, same as 5 years ago, and recipe not changed and always on the menu.	2.0
Mediocre food maybe at best, with typical "pizza time" style pizza and wings. Any of the alternate pizza places along route 5 are by far a better choice than this. Pizza is thick and beyond flavorless (more than half was left untouched) and the wings accompanying my order were bland and looked sickening. Also by the way my delivery order was near an hour late. I hate to give such a review on a new business but i wouldnt want others to go through the same experience.	1.0
Tried to walk in at 4:30pm yesterday without a reservation and were told it'd be a 40min wait; walked to the nearest bar to have a drink and returned when they texted only to be told we missed our window and would have to wait another 30minutes! We practically sprinted down the block to get there within 10minutes of their text and even after texting "we're on our way" as we walked, they still didn't hold a table for us. We simply couldn't enjoy the meal after receiving such poor treatment simply to get a table! Will never attempt to go again.	1.0
Sat at the bar for dinner. Tried the wings, pork belly, tapioca cake. The wings tasted only of overused grease. The pork belly dish was just pork belly submerged in soy sauce. Rice is an extra charge here. The tapioca cake was hard and fairly tasteless. The sticky rice was not sticky rice. I have been to Thailand and have eaten many different dishes while there from restaurants, roadside stalls and in remote villages out in the jungle. None of the food I saw at Pok Pok NY was like the food I have seen in Thailand. Sorry to say that the food at Pok Pok NY was not good. The bartenders were not the friendliest people either. The cocktails I tried were okay, but not great.	1.0
Disappointed	1.0
We were a group of 12.  The hostess seated us at a table which really seated 8 comfortably.  When we asked to have another table added to accommodate us she got an attitude.  When we asked a question to one of the wait staff, she was rude.  As for food, with the exception of the chicken wings, food was mediocre.  We were told by the wait staff, their entrees are family style.  No way - we ordered 4 or 5 of the same dishes for our group.  Rice - $3 a small bowl - outrageous!  We ordered Pet Pha Lo (duck dish) - really where was the duck meat???????? The rating of 1 star  is only for the Chicken wings.  We all agreed we would not return.  Restaurant Manager - fire that Hostess!	1.0
I feel sad writing this review - the food is very good, being real Thai food rather than that overly sweetened American version, but the new space is not very pleasant and the service is impersonal and lackluster.  The overall feeling is one of being shuttled in and out of Port Authority at rush hour by a crew of harried traffic cops with walkie talkies.   Even so, I wouldn't mind any of this if the pricing was't so offensive.  Portions are small, prices are high.  This is meant to be honest, unpretentious food from Southeast Asia, and Pok Pok has the plastic plates and tablecloths to prove it.  It also has small $19 entrees.   I'll be at Ayada next time.	2.0
Rudest check in ever. Completely unwelcoming. Refused to honor a reservation because we were delayed a few minutes. The charm of a wet blanket.  We were treated as if they were doing us a favor by seating us.	1.0
Don't come here unless you want they make money off you for doing nothing!  Came here just for one order of wings to take out. It was 16.33 with taxes and plus they charged you an extra dollar for take out. Okay fine then. We gave them 20 dollar exact. So please help me do the math, how much should I get back from them? 2.67? Yes? Of course.  But we got 2.50 back. Didn't even notice at first.  But when I looked at the check again, I wondered why we only got 2.50 instead of 2.67. So we asked the servers.  The answer from them was pretty damn DISAPPOINTING.  "We rounded up the bill. And sometimes you may get more money back." Don't know if they just plain lazy or we were just so unlucky today that we got SCAM on. It's not about that 17 cents difference. Its about how you do business, an honest and respectful business. You earn what you deserve for the food and services.  Not for doing nothing because you round things up. I wonder if we, as customers, could ever give less to them then. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!	1.0
Their policy for seating is telling you they have a 1.5h to order for you to go to the bar in front ( also owned by them) and then 20 min later ( once you have ordered your drinks) they text you that table is ready. Mind you that when you get there you see empty tables everywhere. Obnoxious and ridiculous way of getting people to spend their money...	1.0
Not quite sure what the big deal is about Pok Pok. The ambience is fun. Service was friendly. The menu had such promise and I had heard such good things but the food was not particularly spicy or flavorful, the signature wings were kind of dry, the desserts were so-so - all around, a kind of disappointing meal and on par with the quality of most of the average, neighborhood Thai places I have tried. Not quite the special meal with family I was hoping for.	2.0
Maybe this is a place that people either really love or really hate.  Or maybe the food is actually amazing, but some people find the whole experience ruined by the long wait while others just don't care.  Waited about 2.5 hours for a party of 8 people on a Saturday night.  As the wait grew longer, my expectation of the food went up exponentially.  My group went to the bar across the street, also run by the same people who run Pok Pok.   We were seated and greeted by a friendly staff.  Ordered the passion fruit martini and it was quite good.  Flavorful with a hint of alcohol - just the way I like it.  Ordered a bunch of food and shared it with the group, family-style.  The pork belly / shoulder curry was OK.  Very oily, the curry was not too strong to overpower the taste of the pork.  Brussell sprouts were also pretty good.  The other dishes ordered were a blur - it wasn't the martini or the Singha lite - but just wasn't memorable.  The plates are all relatively small and could rival larger tapas plates.  The prices were not too bad, but relative to the portions, were just OK. Was it worth the trip?  No.  Unfortunately, my memory of the experience was more about long wait for a table than the actual food.  People were talking about how the chef travels around Thailand, finding the unique dishes from different regions of the country.  He puts his take on his experiences providing a unique dining experience for customers at his restaurant.  If I was all into "trying new, unique dishes" and "finding something different", I would be excited about Pok Pok.  However, I'm more about "finding value in good tasting dishes" more than the other aforementioned things.  So Pok Pok wasn't worth the wait and isn't worth a return trip for me.	2.0
What a terrible meal. I got the khao soi, it was extremely oily and greasy. The chicken was floating in the soup with bones. The noodles were soft and soggy. I rarely leave food behind but I couldn't eat this. To boot the service sucked. Had to flag someone down after 5 minutes to get noticed. Would not recommend this place	1.0
Many years ago I used to eat at Pok Pok in Portland with my family, and the meals were an absolute delight. Fresh and surprising ingredients, friendly and relaxing atmosphere. It makes me sad to say, but they have completely failed to retain that charm in NYC. Two visits to this place, and I won't be back. It is impossible to order food until you've been forced to go through at least one round of cocktails, usually an underwhelming combination of lime juice and simple syrup with some kind of dry flaky herb. Would you like to have some 5 dollar peanuts while you wait? Would you like to be treated like you are a small herd of unpleasant animals as you wait to overpay for a light meal? Having waited long enough to be deemed worthy at the bar, you are then rudely told to settle immediately with the bartender, then settle into a totally ordinary dining area to pay 20 bucks and up for small plates that range from mildly interesting to insulting. They get one star for consistently tasty wings. Yes, they are expensive, no, they're not the best thing you've ever eaten, they're just the only thing this place can do right. Both times I've left here feeling a little swindled, and a lot condescended to. I never felt that way at their original venture on the West Coast, and I never feel that way at any of the numerous great local restaurants within a five minute walk of Pok Pok.	2.0
I really wanted to love you, Pok Pok. No, I really wanted to like you. I really just wanted to find at least ONE salvageable reason as to why I should ever come back again... Didn't happen. This is no reflection on my opinion of Andy Ricker and Pok Pok (Portland) whom and which I absolutely love and respect. Quite possibly this was a rare dining experience but also just one of the most disappointing ones I've ever had to endure. Who knew food could make you so sad? Anyways, it all started with the sticky rice... which wasn't so sticky. Yet, every sticky rice aficionado or just rice common sense-ist (I'm Asian so I will naturally claim both) will know that rice, although delivered in a cute little woven basket, should not be served dry, hard, and practically inedible. I tried my best to give them the benefit of the doubt by just sucking it up but when something like dry rice that tasted like plastic starts interfering with your overall experience and nearly chipping a tooth, you gotta say something. So I did. I'll be honest, I'm the type to be embarrassed to complain and send something back to the kitchen (for fear of my food getting fucked with), but this was just awful. After the manager returned with a new side of JASMINE rice, he condescendingly said,"So I went back to the kitchen to try the sticky rice and it's definitely up to par with what we typically serve..." No shit, Shirlock. You went back and had a taste of a new batch of fresh sticky rice. Either way, the considerate thing to have done was also bring a new delivery of sticky rice and possibly prove us wrong, but hey, whatever. Either way, I hate to say this but the rest of the meal just went downhill after that... In addition to the wings (good, but too salty and surprisingly dry), we ordered the Papaya Salad, Pork Belly/Pork Shoulder, and Boar Collar. All. Underwhelming. Except I should've known when the waitress had told us 45 minutes and instead it ended up being an hour-and-a-half, possibly longer had we not said anything while having drinks at The Whiskey Soda Lounge. Just another overrated hipster hotspot for wannabe foodies to come and say they've experienced authentic "ethnic food." Just a bummer.	1.0
Wings: this is the reason I keep coming, but this time they were so salty I couldn't even finish them; still delicious, but waaaay to salty. Some customers beside us were saying exactly the same. Disappointing. Spare ribs: barely warm, and totally plain; there is NO way they cooked those express... felt like they were leftovers from lunch; the sauces they came with were uninspiring to say the least. We wanted to order more, but we stopped there. Last time we were disappointed by several dishes, and after seeing they f...ed up they best dishes, we were too afraid to order more. They are not exactly cheap, so we went elsewhere and finished dinner. After being a huge fan of this place, I had to hit the wall here twice, before realizing that it's not worth anymore. The only good thing left is the name. Unfortunately, I have no reason to ever go back.	1.0
Actually if i could rate this zero stars, I would. I have traveled and lived all over the world, and consider myself kind of a foodie. I have seen many an episode of Anthony Bourdain and Andy Ricker, and said hey it would be nice to have some cool Thai food in NYC which isn't the equivelant of street food in Thailand; lets give this a whirl. I could not have been more disappointed, the service was a cross between trendy self affected and hipster (odd mix huh!), and the food was over priced crap. I ordered a Thai Sausage dish and mixed veggies, and got one single sausage and a wedge of raw cabbage for $14. Then we ordered another pork dish which was so hot (I'm a massive fan of hot food and have traveled all of India), it had to be sent back. In its place we got a savory pork belly curry, there were 3 pieces, one was 90% fat, one was 60% fat and the 3rd was acceptable. When we asked our waiter if anyone actually was expected to eat the fat he responded, well some people do; oh and that dish was $18 for fat. I was amused when the waiter asked us if we wanted to pay another $3 for a portion of rice to dip in the drippings, I mean curry. All in all a truly annoying experience, we had 2 beers, 2 dishes (if you can call them that) and a sticky rice..... the cost for this wonderful feast $60. Never again! not even with Bill Gates money, oh and Anthony well he should be ashamed of himself for propping this place up.	1.0
I read about this place before my friends and I came for dinner. Perhaps it was because I was expecting this place to live up to the hype, maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it's because I'm used to eating authentic cuisine in general (which sometimes get mixed up with sentimental value - in regards to eating in an urban American environment), but I had a lackluster experience with the food here. First off- 1.5 hour wait. I ended up drinking three tamarind whiskey sours In Whiskey Soda Bar in that time. Whatever. The dinner: Shared a fresh herbal salad (Yam Samun Phrai), which was delicious. It was savory and had a depth of flavor. Parsnips really made the salad as well. Then the fried grouper - which was a disappointment. This was based on the waiter's recommendations. Hard to pick at, overly fried, sauce on the side (which is fine). The fish should have been soft and moist inside, but it was drier than usual. I should have requested a few chillies on the side - that might have brightened the dish up. My friends ordered a vegetarian curry noodle dish, which I opted out of trying because it was so small. Then Affogato for dessert. I suppose the issue really is the price. High price for small portions. I'd prefer to go to Sri Phai Phai (ask them to prepare specific regional dishes off the menu and they would do it) for suitable portions. I mean, come on, Pok Pok - Street food at these prices? Tsk. It's like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering rice porridge with thousand year egg and having to pay 15 bucks for that stuff. I would also prefer not to have my waiter meticulously break down cuisine to the point where I am told how I should eat it and the emphasis on sharing, family style. If it's Asian, it's usually family style. If I wanted to get a lecture on how to eat Thai street food, I'll go to "Any-town" Thailand, where I'll meet a local, who will simply indicate for me to "Come EAT!" (Or I can just ride my bike to Woodside or Elmhurst and hang out with some neighbors who will say, "Eat!"). At which point I'll rip the food apart with my hands and lick them clean. re:Don't tell me how to eat.   At the end of the day, it's just food. It's meant to be ingested and shat out. We spent a $135 bucks plus tip on three tiny dishes, a dessert and a few drinks - between three women. I went to sleep hungry. Thanks for nothing, Andy Ricker.	2.0
I came a long way from Virginia Beach, VA to enjoy a weekend out in about around NYC. We don't have many Thai restaurants in VB, so my friend decided to take me to Pok Pok. After hearing about how great the fish sauce wings I wanted to try more of their menu. We arrive around 5:30 pm and the hostess said it would be a 40 minute wait. No problem, so we put our names down and head across the street to get a couple drinks and try the wings at their sister bar, The Whiskey Soda Lounge. After 30 minutes, I go over to check and the hostess said our table will be ready in about 10 minutes. So we close out our tab at the Whiskey Soda Lounge and head over. We sit down and receive menus and water. Our Server, MATT G., again his name is MATT G., never introduced himself and gave such a bad attitude, it made me hesitant to try the place. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because my friend and I also waited tables while attending college and just thought maybe he was busy, and will come around. I ordered the Khanom Jiin Sao Naam, and the menu is misleading because I was under the impression it would be hot noodles. I took two bites and immediately regretted my decision. My friend got the  Muu Paa Kham Waan, I tried that and it was delicious. Now as a prior server, I understand to make the customer feel like they have an enjoyable dining experience. I would expect sympathy from a fellow server, but alas I was surprised to MATT G.'s reaction. I asked MATT G. if there was any way I could exchange the dish I had with another entree, while telling him it's not what I expected.  Instead of apologizing and asking what he could do to make the experience more enjoyable, his first question was "Well, What did you expect?" Taken aback, I answered honestly, and said I thought the dish would be hot, it didn't say in your menu that these noodles would be cold. After adjusting his tampon like he just started his period, Without saying anything else, he takes the dish away from the table, puts a menu down in front of me. I tell him I'll just have the same dish my friend is having. He rolls his eyes and takes the menu back up. At that point I lost my entire appetite and just wanted the check and the meal to go. Another server brings my new entree out, and I immediately ask for the box and the check. The other server brings me back a box and I quickly empty it into the container. We sit there for another 15 minutes with both our plates empty and MATT G. still hasn't come by with the check. He finally comes and clears off the table, still with the worst attitude like he heard he just got Syphilis. After we pay the check, I still say thank you, and he doesn't say a word to me. He doesn't say anything to my friend either. I give the food that I did try - the fish sauce wings and the Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) 5 stars. I want to give MATT G. just the single server out of the entire restaurant 0 Stars for service. Hey MATT G., if you want to serve tables, treat your customers as you want to be treated. Not like they are a nuisance or a hassle. Because although the food was delicious (besides the cold noodles) no one wants to be treated like shit when they go out and pay money for a dining experience.	1.0
The meal began with the dreaded, "Have you dined with us before?" question.  This establishment would require an orientation session. Certainly, the dishes and their descriptions were largely unfamiliar. Pok pok is bringing different dishes to the table--this is not typical central Thailand food found in the U.S. and it's also, I believe, a little different from the northeastern Isan cuisine that's now popular. This is, rather, Northern Thai cuisine. I struggled to keep an open mind while reflecting on the absurdity of trendanista Brooklynites waiting on line for Thai food cooked by a guy from Portland while a hop and skip over in Elmhurst, Queens lies a half-dozen or so of the best Thai restaurants in the country, minus the menu orientation sessions. My friend's Khao soi was a classic northern Thai dish. Here, it was served as a very small bowl with an overwhelming mound of fried noodles on top of the boiled noodles in the broth.  The ratio of noodles to broth seemed off, and the taste of the broth was disappointing. It was thin, not rich and complex.  My friend, who has been to the Pok Pok in Portland many times, reports that the dish at the original restaurant is very different and much, much better. My catfish over vermicelli noodles was also bland and disappointing.  The one redeeming feature was the tasty array of fresh and flavorful herbs in the dish.  But the fish was bland and the sauce was blah as well. Having recently had the most incredible soft shell crab and mango salad at Ayada in Queens,  the contrast was stark.	2.0
For the prices and long wait times, I seriously expected better. I wasn't impressed by the chicken wings, catfish, ribs, thai iced tea, lime drink, or sticky rice at all. I felt bad for choosing this restaurant for my birthday dinner because my host didn't like it at all.Definitely not worth the hype in my opinion, though the restaurant is cute and there's a really nice view in front to watch the sunset.	2.0
I really do not understand the hype. I was hesitant to come here even though I live only a block away because many of my friends around this area are not complimentary about this place. However, when I read the reviews, it sounded like it might be o.k. so I gave it a shot. We went around 5 p.m. and there was no line. When we walked in the hostess was screaming out loud at a waiter about something personal before seating us. We got seated and received soapy water to drink. When I pointed this out and asked for another (soapy and filmy), they took it away, got a bit of attitude and never bought water back. I had to ask again. Eventually, we received the same soapy water in the same cup, at least for mine (It had a block scrap on the bottom in a funny shape). Apparently, they just put the bad water along with the rest and redistributed back to us. I found this funny. Decided to give my kids their sippies and the adults to do without water altogether. Now to the food... We ordered the ribs, the wings and a fish dish. They were all just o.k. at best. You had to pay for rice separately (we did) and the fare is nothing remotely interesting or unique. It sounds much better on the menu. The ribs and wings can be found in a chinese restaurant which confused me, isn't this thai food. The fish was the best out of all the dishes because it was at least interesting but relatively bland compared to authentic northern thai. I have eaten amazing Thai food before. This is not that. The food came quickly and they hustled us out to make room for more patrons as soon as possible. I can forgive bad service for amazing food (I almost prefer those restaurants) and I can forgive amazing service for decent food but I cannot forgive bad service for mediocre food (above average prices at that). I will never come back but at least I tried it.	1.0
This place is all hype no substance. Given we wanted to go on a weekend so we were prepared for rejection. We arrived and was asked to sub as the doorman by the  hostess. How do you  keep a door closed when there are 8 people in the entrance way? We then requested to be on the wait list - they said 2 to 2.5 hour wait. So we left our number and asked them to call us 15min before the sitting. An hour and a half later we get a call saying that our table will be given up if we don't get there within 10 min. We were in the middle of running some errands but rushed back in 20 min. and got a table. We ordered the minced duck/liver dish, eggplant, chicken wings, minced pork. All the meat dishes were overspiced to the point where i had to send the pork back. Seriously spending a couple of years in cooking  in the kitchens of Thailand doesn't  make you a master of a millennium of food culture. Go to  SriPraPhai, Zabb Elee, or Thai Market much better food without the pretentiousness and the $$$. One thing that they didn't learn spend years in the culture is the Thai hospitality .	1.0
Beware! Think twice eating at this establishment. I was billed extra while checking my credit card statement. They put in a few extra dollars in Tips. Unbelievable since I tipped them 16-17%. Shame on them! I had the female waitress so be careful and check your statement if you do decide to eat there...  Wished I could've given this a 0 star.  Shame on them!!	1.0
One star because we have to give at least 1 to write a review. 6 skinny chicken wings for $15 covered with sticky fish sauce which rendered the skin gloppy and chewy with almost no meat since these were without a doubt seriously underfed chickens.   After eating 3 of these wings - We were no longer hungry because they were terrible and truly sickening.  The flavor would not leave our mouth a half hour later.  They were over salted, sour, and sweet in a very bad way NOT in a good way as other sweet & sour dishes customarily are. We do not know what all the hype is about here.  We make far better chicken wings in our own home without using skinny chickens.   We shudder to think just how unhealthy this mess was. We are dumbfounded by all the hype here.  We would never let these pass our lips again - EVER!!	1.0
don't know what you people call thai food. but this ain't thai.  nothing is authentic here.  and trying to give it a new twist they've made it taste all wrong. won't frequent it...too far away anyway.	1.0
1) This is NYC, I ain't walking that far from any subway to eat just so these mother fuckers can save money on rent 2) When i sat down the server asked me "do you want to order everything you saw on the show?", I'm like "bitch what show?" And most important, 3) Although the food was fine I don't recall ordering a sodomy! This junk was crazy overpriced (especially considering you're buying off-cuts like pork neck) Overall, I'd rather lick a homeless man's back in the lower east side before going back to this joint	1.0
I had an encounter with the original owner 15 years prior for taking ketchup packets from my take out bag because I used the ketchup bottle on the table for my fries. His statement was " well I guess you don't need these packets if your using my bottle " I was angered by it and shouted. He shouted back telling me to " take my black ass out of his diner "  This happened 15 years prior when I was 18 , now 33 I took my wife and bi-racial kids to the diner after a viewing at the Peabody museum for lunch since its the nearest diner. I didn't forget my past experience but figured the older guy owner must be gone and things just have to be better. BIG NO. Upon entering the diner the older white haired lady greeted me but once she saw my wife and children it was nothing but frowns and stares in our direction. My wife asked me why did she look at her that way and I just brushed it off as nothing. As we ordered the white haired woman was speaking to a staff member " saying times have changed and she hasn't gotten use to the mixing of people" Now at this point I walked up and demanded the bill. I tipped our waiter 20% on top of the bill. My wife asked me to sit down at our table just so our daughter could finish her oatmeal. While sitting there the older woman asked a waiter if the table of 7 left her a tip. When the waiter replied no they didn't , this woman speaking loudly expressed that the people should have left a tip and it must be because of were they are from. all 7 were black. Now totally disgusted I asked the waiter what was the amount of there bill? while asking her this the white haired woman asked me what do I care what there bill was and if I knew them. The waiter replied to me and said about $40.00. I tipped for that table as well. Me and my family left and will never return there as long as it stands!	1.0
The food is what one would expect at a greasy spoon diner, no complaint here. The staff is nice enough but the cashier is rude and generally unfriendly. This has been my experience on more than one occasion and I will not be patronizing them in the future.	1.0
Food is decent, service kind of sucks. I ordered a burger which took a long time. Then they wanted to charge me for a Sprite refill. What is this 1989?	1.0
I have never been driven to write a review about any dining establishment but I feel like the service here was so awful that I would be selfish not to warn my fellow New Haven residents not to go here. The hostess (blonde, older woman) was so dismissive and rude from the moment I walked in. She barely acknowledged me, only looking up to say that one side of the diner was closed (in a very condescending tone, like I should have known). When I went to pay for a mediocre meal (after waiting 10 minutes to get the check), she told me the credit card machine was broken. That's something you might want to tell someone when they are walking in. She then made me leave my phone and go to a bank to get money for a SEVEN DOLLAR CHECK, making me late to work (which she knew, I told her that would happen if I had to drive to a bank and back). When I went back to pay, I told her that the right thing to do for a first time customer would be to say it's on the house, guaranteeing that I would come back. She completely ignored everything I was saying, eventually just saying, "Goodbye" over my voice repeatedly until I walked out. Perhaps this woman doesn't reflect the establishment as a whole, but she has guaranteed I will never go here and I will make sure no one I know goes here. If the owner or manager is reading this, fire her immediately.	1.0
I've been here a few times, which was a few times too many. I really wish this place were better; I live so close and it's open 24 hours. The food has been OK (2 stars, even on a diner-food scale), but the thing that really sinks Cody's in my mind is the service. Vignette 1: My wife and in-laws went for a late lunch (~3pm) and took a booth. Shortly thereafter a huge group of schoolkids show up. The waitress wouldn't even take our orders until after all of those kids had their food, EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOWED UP AFTER US. Vignette 2: I stopped in to get a take-out lunch. I ordered my food and when it came out, the cashier had disappeared. I waited another 5 minutes for her to return, as did another table that wanted to pay and leave. The waitress told us she would lose her job if she took our money. So both the other table and I ended up leaving cash (meaning I left more of a tip than was warranted). Of course when I got home (2 blocks away), the food was cold. Vignette 3: The same cashier told my father in-law that the credit card reader was acting really slow, and suggested he walk to an ATM to get cash.	1.0
I love diners... but this one was awful. I went to this diner simply because I needed a place to do some late night studying and this was the only nearby place that came up when I googled "24 hour cafe". I was happy to see that there was a somewhat separate part of the dining section with outlets for my laptop, perfect to set up my little study station. This is where my satisfaction ended. I ordered a small breakfast sandwich and coffee because I knew it would be rude to just sit and study.... the coffee was mehhh, but the sandwich was okay. However, once the server dropped me my sandwich she did not come back to my table. She did not top off my coffee, (which I was bummed about because when it comes to coffee I am a bottomless pit), clear away my plate, or ask me if I wanted anything else. She didn't even give me my check. I ended up having to walk up and ask for it and, of course, when I did I saw a sign saying you have to spend a minimum of $7 in order to pay with a card - I had only spent $4 something and had zero cash on me. Just to get out of there I had her just charge my card $7... definitely wasn't worth it and I will never go back.	1.0
I have lived in New Haven my whole life and have visited Cody's a handful of times at various times. This past Sunday I went in for breakfast/brunch with two friends around 12:30 p.m. It took over 30 minutes for two eggs, potatoes, toast and an order of waffles to be served. After the food was served there was no available silverware. The waitresses response was sorry you'll just have to wait. So as all of our food got cold and my friend's waffles got soggy, she also failed to serve a second order of bacon, which was ordered because they were out of sausage and a bagel that was ordered was never even served! My friend with the waffles who happens to be a cook, couldn't even eat the food and walked out. My friend and I with the eggs used one for and a SPOON from her coffee. For the record, after there was available silverware, maybe 20 minutes later, the waitress never brought us any. We of course, being servers ourselves, tipped over 20% and went to pay our bill. We shared our experience with the owner, as we are frequent patrons. She was rude, told us we were the only ones that complained and that she "Wasn't feeling well today." No apology, no food removed from the bill, RUDENESS! I used to LOVE Cody's DInner, for late nights after the bar, a quick lunch and of course breakfast, yet I will NEVER return!	1.0
This place used to be our favorite until it's recently fell into a decline. The attitude is horrid. Last time we were sternly told that we could not sit at the table we've sat as that was spared for 3 people. It was laughable as the two twosome tables were opposed and could easily be detached. Besides it was 6:00pm and 75% of all other bar tables were empty. Riposo was elevated to a fine restaurant not a bar anymore although all they offer is bar setting and bar food. Unacceptably arrogant for a place of mediocre food and wine...Cheap attitude comes with not so heap menu. But, thanks to the attitude we discovered Sambuca wine bar next door which is a few levels up with similar prices, better food, civilized treatment	1.0
Terrible service unfortunately. I am confident the evening could have gone differently,  but our server had a bad attitude from the time we sat down, and it escalated from there. We left after 20 minutes. There is no reason why, in a city like NYC, one must ever subject themselves to terrible service. There are too many excellent options out there. Riposo 72, however, is not one of them.	1.0
I walked in to this place yesterday to have a nice glass of wine with a group of my girlfriends and the first thing I see is a mouse scurrying across the floor.  I ran outside, horrified.  Needless to say, we didn't get our drink there, but my girlfriend convinced me to go back in and mention it to the waitress so she wasn't surprised when if she saw it or didn't have to deal with an angry customer.  I snuck back in, ready to dash out at any sign of movement, and told her what I had seen.  She said they have had repeated problems and have tried to exterminate many times to no avail!    I signed up on yelp just for this purpose because I just thought people should know that the waitress admitted to me that they have a severe vermin infestation problem. Gross!	1.0
The flatbread was soggy and I got food poisoning after eating at this place. There was a mouse that ran across the floor of the restaurant  and when I told the waitress she didn't seem surprised and told me that they have been trying to get that mouse for months!? Buy a mouse trap- it's not that hard! Stay away from this establishment!	1.0
I live on the block so I've been here a few times already, which have been mostly mediocre experiences; nothing that stood out one way or the other. On Monday, I met a friend, who was in town for the evening, there for a drink. The woman who was tending bar that night was heinous, she should not be allowed to work with customers. There were only two couples in the whole place aside from us and it still took her ten minutes to turn her attention to us, after a couple of "excuse mes." For our second round, she ignored us for long minutes because she was staring at two guys who had just come in but had no intention of staying. She then poured me a second glass of prosecco, which was completely flat. I sent it back and she started loudly arguing with me claiming that she poured it from the same bottle. This was clearly untrue, because the second glass was the end of the bottle, where the first one came from a bottle over half-way full (nobody else was drinking prosecco). She was  just trying to get rid of the last bit of an old bottle at the end of the night, with no trace of bubbles, hoping I wouldn't notice. She claimed she had tasted it and it was fine. I don't enjoy being lied to and argued with when I send back the tiniest $10 glass of prosecco because it's undrinkable, IN A WINE BAR. Until this woman is relegated to the back to wash dishes, I will not be back. I'd rather walk a couple of blocks to Wine & Roses, Barcibo, or Bin 72 than put up with service like that again. This place won't last long in a neighborhood that has plenty of options with better service.	1.0
I went to this spot last night with 4 friends ... the place is cute, atmosphere is perfect.  However ... about 1/2 way into our meal, there was an enormous cockroach CLIMBING UP THE WALL!  Our table jumped a mile, and the waitress came over to try to kill it... but it got away.  Horrible and gross, but NYC.  Well ... as we continued to sit (uneasy) 2 more were climbing up a wall on the other side of the restaurant!  AND then a woman came screaming out of the bathroom that there were 2 in there ... We asked for our bill and paid and got the hell out.  I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again!!  It clearly doesn't deserve an A rating and I have already contacted the board of health!	1.0
Unfortunately this place has become too big for its boots.  Aside from jacking up their prices a lot, they instituted a nonsensical seating policy.  At 5.45 pm, when the place was deserted, they had pushed 2 narrow tables together at the back of the dining room and declared they were for 3-  or 4-somes only.  On our previous 6 or 7 visits to this place we had sat here as a couple with no problem, but now they were expecting a rush of people I suppose.  So we left and went to Sambuca, just up the street where they were nice and friendly and cheaper too.  On our way back past Riposo  about 90 minutes later they still had not filled their tables, so I really don't know what their problem was about.   Go here if you don't mind unfriendliness, otherwise avoid.	1.0
TERRIBLE experience with wait staff on NYE no less!!! I took my whole family to Riposo 72 on NYE since it has a decent wine selection and was close to the park, so that we could catch the fireworks. When we got there, the restaurant was half empty (probably a first for me, its usually busy). Since we wanted to stay out of the draft from the doorway, we choose a table in the window and proceeded to settle in. I had a long day walking about so I asked the server if I could switch my stool for a high back chair. SHE SAID NO (although there were about 10 free high back chairs along the bar). Now, having been here a few times, I thought that she was being difficult, but thought that she might be fine if I told her that I would change it back if the bar started to fill up. CLEARLY I UNDERESTIMATED HER DETERMINATION TO KEEP THE CHAIRS, NOT THE CUSTOMERS HAPPY. She promptly came back over and ask my party to LEAVE, since I had not adhered to her chair rule. SUCH RUDE behavior and on a night when most ppl are just looking to have a few drinks and kick back. Needless to say, MOLLY RICHARDS, the server, should not be in the customer service business, or really have any kind of job where she has the power to be rude to people for very little reason. Though I have always enjoyed Riposo 72 for its ambiance, the food and wine are ok, and not good enough to tempt me back given the bad treatment.	1.0
I'm sorry but I don't think a "wine bar" should have sports TVs blaring. I thought the concept of wine bar was romantic, sexy.  Nope, not here. It's crowded, loud and feels like some kind of compromise destination for women afflicted with sports-nut partners.	1.0
I went to Riposo 72 last night to try something new in my neighborhood. The inside is cozy and cute, and the wine was good (I had a Malbec). The food; however, was a different story. My boyfriend and I both ordered the arugula salad to start - and although it was good, I could have made it myself for much cheaper. It was basically just arugula tossed with a smidge of dressing with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and with 4 tiny pieces of grapefruit - nothing special. Then, we shared the mushroom flatbread pizza for the main course. Had I know it would take light years to make, I would have just left and made one myself. 50 minutes later when our pizza finally came (mind you, the server never once apologized for the ridiculous wait), we were disappointed to find that it was just NOT GOOD. I think they made the crust with matza, and they must have bought the red onions/mushrooms at the street cart on 72nd because there was nothing gourmet about it at ALL. Again, I could have made this pizza at home for cheaper and in half the time! The worst part about this experience was the bill came to $80 - I would recommend that you go spend your $80 around the corner at Bin 71 instead of wasting it on bad pizza and un-interesting salads.	1.0
I have a rule. I don't insult places with a "one" any more. But this is a Supreme Food Court decision. Please, please, please take this place back to the way it used to be. I can remember when my friend David Balinsky from U of P Facilities took me here in 1984. I was a veggie and I was really afraid, but they made the most fabulous veggie steak I ever had, and I've NEVER had another as good--anywhere. LAter when I diverged, had the steak, and it was everything everyone said it was. Now--just a relic of the former. It could be so much more, but they would need U of P's help and police to clean up the tramps. I also saw the biggest rat-the size of a cat at the 7-11. Nasty. It will take ALL the tenants to chip in too. But with so much potential, this block could be dynamite again.	1.0
Food-wise, it's a generic pizza/wings/sandwich place. Not amazing, but not unpalatable. Apparently, though, it costs extra to have one three-topping pizza and one one-topping pizza as opposed to two two-topping pizzas. Not to mention they take an hour and a half to deliver them, and when we called, the gal on the phone had the gall to say she didn't think it had been that long despite, you know, phones having time stamps these days. If you're hungry and in the mood for delivery, try another one of the bazillion nearby pizza/wing/sandwich places. You won't be missing anything.	1.0
Sketchy tables, unfriendly staff, poor quality-tasting meat and underwhemling bread. All that made for a below average cheesesteak. And yes, I got it with the whiz. The only things Abner has going for it is that it's pretty much the only cheesesteak restaurant in University City and it gives some deals if the local university sport teams do super well. Too bad there's a smattering of food trucks that do cheesesteaks just as well, if not better than Abner's. Be nice to your stomach, find a different place to fix that hunger.	1.0
I have not eaten here in some time, but even now I remember how bad this place was. While visiting Philadelphia with my family, I asked a passer-by where I could get a good authentic Philly Cheesesteak and he kindly pointed me in the direction of Abner's (telling me it was the best place in town).  Well, I apparently asked the only other tourist in a 5 block radius or had some local playing a cruel joke on me because Abner's was anything but good. The beef was flavorless and rubbery (I almost stole the salt and pepper shaker to take with me), the cheese only exacerbated the problem, and the bread roll was terrible.  I could have microwaved a piece of beef jerky, thrown it between 2 pieces of Wonder bread, squirted some cheese whiz on it and still made a more appetizing sandwich. If this is best place to pick up the city's signature food, I'm surprised there has not been a mass exodus out of Philly in search of sustenance.	1.0
I had not eaten here for a long time, and since I was in the neighborhood, i thought I'd stop in as I remembered it as being a pretty good steak shop. It was started by the guy who was one of the originals at Jim's. Well Jim's (or almost anyplace else) has nothing to fear from Abner's. The place has really gone to seed, and my sandwich was undersized, the roll was doughy, and there was a vaguely funky taste that came from the onions. It looked like the grille could use a cleaning, and the rest of the place seemed a little hygiene-impaired. Oh well.	1.0
half way through my meal after eating 3 half peices of toast i realized the crust of the toast was thick with mold. I couldn't eat another bite. told the waitress she said im sorry and gave us the bill anyway didn't offer to take the meal off. i told the manager while paying up front , he asked me if i ate the omelette part said yes i ate half of it, so they took 3 dollars off the 8 dollar omelette...i should have threatened to call the health department if they didn't remove the item from the bill atleast, i don't like the idea paying anything for a meal that had mold on it. i wont be eating there ever again	1.0
I got the breakfast special, french toast was undercooked and soggy, scrambled eggs were OK. My girlfriend liked her chocolate chip pancakes. On my way out the door, I bought 2 stale old ass cookies as big as a frisbee for $2.15 each, what a jip, took one bite and threw them away. I'm not going back.	1.0
Disgusting. I had a bug crawl out of the lettuce of my burger.  I'm not kidding. I've seen used syringes on the floor of the bathroom. The only reason to go here is to people watch.  The characters that go here and actually enjoy the food are unreal. Trust me, STAY AWAY.  You won't be missing much. If you're hungry late at night, you're probably safer and better off eating gas station fried chicken in Hartford. Poor standards.	1.0
I ordered a tuna melt and it tasted and smelled like cheap dark tuna, or maybe it was cat food tuna.  I couldn't eat it.  A family owned diner as such, you never know what kind of quality of ingredients they are using in the food they serve you.  There is little to no outside control over it.  I would rather go to Panera or Cosi's where I know I am going to get good quality all the time.  The french fries were good, as was the dessert.  The service was from a woman who spoke jive and was from the ghetto.	1.0
The service is always slow and the wait staff have an 'I don't care' attitude. Only drunks come in. Being open 24 hours is the only plus.	1.0
I watched the waitresses pick garbage up off the floor, rummage through the garbage can to find something someone lost and then turn around and bring food to tables. I was disgusted but didn't want to embarrass my husband by leaving.   When our food arrived the waitress left the check and then never once came back to see if we needed anything or if the food was ok.  After about 15 minutes the "greater" was actually the one who filled our coffee cups. Yes, it was busy but you get better service at Denny's.	1.0
So we generally don't do late night dinning but we had some family in town and around midnight-ish we decided to grab something to eat but wanted to sit down somewhere. This place is a decent size seems tidy enough. However, I think this is the week of the flies for us because this is the second place we have been to this week that had a fly issue. I don't know what is going on with these places. So we are seated and mind you there were 6 of us and this guy sticks us in a booth. when he walked away the BF and I decided to occupy the booth across the way there just wasn't enough room for 6 grown people in one booth. Then the waiter brings out water for everyone no ice no straws we had to ask for this stuff. So he gives us like 2 minutes and then takes our appetizer order and rushed us into ordering our dinner as well (why is beyond me they are 24 hours) for our appetizer we ordered the stuffed mushrooms which were surprisingly good so one thumb up for that. Then there was my dish i order the Ruben with french fries. Okay, so the sandwich was ordered with pastrami which was surprisingly decent but cut to thick and then there was a lack of sauerkraut and uuummm did we forget the russian dressing, I had to ask for some SMH. To top off this disappointing  experience my french fries were so greasy and dark, they looked like they were cooked in 2 month old grease (don't worry I am smart enough not to have consumed them and neither did the BF). Oh and did I mention the annoying flies OMG. So at check out i complained, normally I don't but I was so tired and aggravated that it took forever to get our food and the flies and dirty grease fries I just couldn't hold it in. The time had come for one of these owners to feel my wrath. (FYI  our appetizer and dinner were brought out at the same time and one person in our party had to wait an extra 5 min. for his food :-(...). So I tend to carry myself well and keep my wits about me so I explained to the manger/owner who was at the check out the issues I had and he was very apologetic and he took $6  off of our check (for me and the BF) so this was a good gesture and for that they get one star. Oh and... P.S. If your thirsty good luck the waiter brought me that first glass of water and he never re-filled it or asked if I would like another. I say stay away if you can, but if everything else is closed and you are starving, the verdict is... eat at your own risk.	1.0
Quick, and cheap	1.0
I've always lived closer to the Vernon Diner and gone to the Goldroc infrequently, but recently have moved closer and had an opportunity to become better acquainted with the Goldroc. There is no delicate way to put this: I can not eat here without getting explosive diarrhea of a type which comes so suddenly that I am rarely able to escape the restaurant before it strikes. Something ain't right here.	1.0
Horrible.  Just horrible. I should've taken all the empty seats/parking spots as a sign. After the waitress went on and on about how horrible the veggie burger was and how I shouldn't order it, we both ordered the grilled "veggie" wraps and a side of mixed vegetables. Aside from the carrots none of the other "steamed" mixed vegetables were the original colors of the vegetables.  They were WAY overcooked and soggy. The wraps only consisted of mushrooms, peppers and a crapload of American cheese.  Tasty but not exactly the health conscious meal we were looking for. Oh and no sweet potato fries.  What diner doesn't have sweet potato fries??   We couldn't wait to get out of there... but we couldn't.  Had to wait for our waitress who was chatting over in a booth somewhere.  When she finally came back we got our check and went to pay and whoever was taking our money was chatting on his cell phone the entire time. What a crappy establishment.	1.0
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy at 2:30am.  The food is beyond bad.  If I knew I could get away with it, I would burn this place down.	1.0
They beat a rat to smithereens all over the restaurant isles after it ran out of the kitchen.  I swear it was so horriffic, the whole restaurant got up and walked out.	1.0
Ugh ugh ugh. My little experience with Goldroc has consisted of this 1: Loud environment 2: Stale or dry or abnormally colored food Central CT has plenty of 24 hour diners around. Try the Triple A in East Hartford if you need something greasy to shake off five hours of whiskey intake.	1.0
Was once good for celebrations... BUT NOT ANYMORE...IF YOU HAVE A PARTY HERE, BE WARNED!!!! There is much to like about Jadis: the décor, the food & wine. Because of this we had eaten there and hosted parties in the lounge several times over the past 3 years. It had always was reasonably priced and that's with copious wine drinking. Sadly, the last party we hosted in December was an unfortunate exception to the rule and we (a party of 12) ended up being charged around $300 more than we should have been in wine. Actually, it was $500 over what was originally planned but I did order a few extra $25 bottles at the end of the night. That being said... THERE IS NO WAY THAT I or anyone else in our party ordered a total of 20 extra bottles for the 6 of us who hung around late.... When we politely disputed the bill, the Mgr. (who was REALLY RUDE and DISMISSIVE)  said that others must have ordered them without us knowing, but our waitress was gone and we did not save the empty bottles to count to prove what we had ordered. He could have said I ordered 500 extra bottles and I would not have had any proof! Even though I arranged the party, I was never asked about orders that I did not make. SO BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR BOTTLES FOLKS! Other than having to pay hundreds more than I had planned, it was ok, but looking back I could have gotten a lot more for the $1000 that I spent on a few apps and some ok  wine ...	1.0
UNBELIEVABLY, DISGUSTINGLY SHOCKING BEHAVIOR BY OWNER, PLEASE NEVER COME HERE.. - almost choked on a piece of metal foil in my wine, took it to waitress and man behind bar (turned out to be the owner) as they attempted to sort out my cheque they double charged me to my credit card, then offered a measly $8 refund for the terrible mistake. Long arguement short, French owner told me I planned it from the start and put the foil in myself, also told me "i must have problems in my personal life" and then in his embarrassing state of rage, as i faced him calmy asking for a refund, yelled at me to "FUCK OFF" twice infront of a bar full of patrons, all over an $18 pitcher of Savigion Blanc.  15 People proceeded to leave afterwards in embarrassment over the owners raised voice and lack of ANY compassion or business nous to offer a calm customer a refund - when I had almost choked on a piece of metal (IN AMERICA) and politely asked for a refund. Really, really, unforgettable and unforgiveable, digusting experience and cant believe me and my girlfriend were disrespected like that. I will never visit this place again and hope you dont support this type of customer service ever. New York is too great to deal with this trash, this guy should lose his liscence.	1.0
THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.  And I didn't even get to try the food (not that I would want to after our terrible experience there!)  After assuring my friend who had called ahead that they could seat 20, my friend made a reservation for our group.  We were led not to a table, but to a back lounge area - quite tight and unexpected but it was fine.  That was our fault for not doing our research on their space.  They did their best to accommodate us with extra chairs and stools.  We were still rather cramped though and asked the waitress if we could adjust one of the couches so we could fit more people.  She agreed and helped us move it and we arranged ourselves. THEN, the owner (?) or another man came and told us to we had to move.  He needed the couch for another party that was coming in.  We said that the waitress allowed us to use it and we were already clearly settled and comfortable.  He did not apologize; he did not offer us another option.  He was pushy and rude and pretty much forced my friends out of the couch they had given us so that they could seat other customers. My entire group walked out.  There are many things that I can be gracious about.  I do not mind if we were all cramped and uncomfortable the entire dinner.  But one thing I cannot STAND is RUDE, BAD SERVICE. DO NOT GO HERE unless you don't mind being treated like crap.	1.0
